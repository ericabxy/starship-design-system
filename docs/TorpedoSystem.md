Torpedo System
--------------

The torpedo system launches a payload which, if it hits, can deal massive damage to the target. The basic version is fitted to fire through the FWD arc, but for extra cost it can be fitted to fire through up to 180° of arc.

Range and Rolling To Hit
------------------------

Targeting with a torpedo system requires one [FireCon](FireControlSystem), which may ONLY be used to fire other torpedo systems at the SAME target this turn. To determine whether the weapon hits, __one__ six-sided die is rolled per system firing at the same target.

| At range of:
| __0-6″__   | Required score to hit: | __2__ to __6__
| __6-12″__  | Required score to hit: | __3__ to __6__
| __12-18″__ | Required score to hit: | __4__ to __6__
| __18-24″__ | Required score to hit: | __5__ or __6__
| __24-30″__ | Required score to hit: | __6__ only

Each hit deals damage points equal to the score of a __second D6__. [Defensive screens](ScreenGenerator) have no effect against this damage.

Long-range Torpedoes
--------------------

Torpedo systems come in a long-range version for ships with the mass to spare to mount them.

__Long-range chance to hit:__

| At range of:
| __0-9″__   | Required score to hit: | __2__ to __6__
| __9-18″__  | Required score to hit: | __3__ to __6__
| __18-27″__ | Required score to hit: | __4__ to __6__
| __27-36″__ | Required score to hit: | __5__ or __6__
| __36-45″__ | Required score to hit: | __6__ only

Short-range Torpedoes
---------------------

Torpedo systems are available in a short-range variety for reduced mass and points costs.

__Short-range chance to hit:__

| At range of:
| __0-4″__   | Required score to hit: | __2__ to __6__
| __4-8″__   | Required score to hit: | __3__ to __6__
| __8-12″__  | Required score to hit: | __4__ to __6__
| __12-16″__ | Required score to hit: | __5__ or __6__
| __16-20″__ | Required score to hit: | __6__ only

Design Procedure
----------------

|               | Bearing          | Mass | Cost
| ------------- | -------          | :--: | ----
| _Short-range_
|               | 60° (1-arc)  | 2    | 6 points
|               | 180° (3-arc) | 3    | 9 points
| _Standard_
|               | 60° (1-arc)  | 4    | 12 points
|               | 120° (2-arc) | 5    | 15 points
|               | 180° (3-arc) | 6    | 18 points
| _Long-range_
|               | 60° (1-arc)  | 8    | 24 points
|               | 120° (2-arc) | 10   | 30 points
|               | 180° (3-arc) | 12   | 36 points

_Experimental:_ 2-arc torpedo systems may be fitted to fire through a forward 120° arc, which must be noted clearly on the ship diagram.

Lore
----

The torpedo system is designed to represent a powerful secondary direct-fire weapon to complement a ship's [main batteries](MainBattery). It can be a _photon torpedo_ or a _plasma cannon_, or something more conventional like a _nuclear missile_ or other _explosive projectile_. The generic background calls it a _pulse torpedo_ and it is a _plasma bolt_ delivered through a gravitic field.
