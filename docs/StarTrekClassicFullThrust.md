<h1>Star Trek Classic Full Thrust v 1.1</h1>

<p>
V1.1 of this document adds a list of miniatures, the Upgraded
Enterprise, Tholians, an excuse for not having Orions and Gorns,
and another Romulan Bird of Prey, (one that corresponds to the
most available miniature).
</p><p>
Yet another adaptation of <b>Star Trek</b> (ST) for <b>Full Thrust
</b> (FT)? Yes, there have been quite a few. But all have been
based on secondary or tertiary sources, most notably <b>Task Force
Games</b> (TFG) <b>Star Fleet Battles</b> (SFB). I'm ancient enough
to remember <b>Gamescience/Lou Zocchi</b>'s <b>Alien Space</b>,
the first<b> Star Trek</b> miniatures rules. <b>Gamescience </b>still
produces a limited range of starships, but no rules, while the
stands on the <b>Starline 2200</b> series still show the 4-quarter
arcs for those rules, over 20 years later. So I prefer going back
to original source materiel, when adapting ST for FT. (In passing,
the <b>Starline 2200</b> and <b>Starline 2300</b> miniatures are
at a scale of 1/3788 ).  Therefore, firstly we have a quick definition
of the Primary Sources.
</p><p>
The basic source for ST(Classic)FT - also known as The Old Star
Trek or The Old Series (TOS) is the <b>Star Trek Star Fleet Technical
Manual</b>  (SFTM) by Franz Joseph Designs, published by Ballantine
in November, 1975. This is the same prime source used by the 
<b>Amarillo Design Bureau</b> (ADB), as mentioned in A1.3 of the
Commander's Edition of SFB. In addition,  the Klingon Battlecruiser
and Romulan Warbird Blueprints (or at least, what I can remember
of them!) have been used, as mentioned in SFB Z.2. Finally of
course, the TV series. Additional "Primary" sources
are the figurines available, and of course, the <b>Full Thrust
</b> and <b>More Thrust</b> Rules by <b>Ground Zero Games</b>
(GZG). One of primary aims of this conversion is that all resultant
designs should be compatible with comparable existing FT ships,
and conform strictly to the rules without exception. They must
also be representable by existing models.
</p><h2>Star Trek Models</h2>

<p>
There are several sources of 1/3788 models in production or still
available as at the time of writing. These are, in approximate
order:
</p><p>
* - Polystyrene Plastic
</p><p>
** - Whitemetal (lead)
</p><p>
*** - Pewter
</p><p>
**** - Vinyl Plastic
</p><p>
<b>Gamescience </b>(still in production)
</p><p>
 Federation Destroyer*, Scout*, Tug*, Heavy Cruiser (ie Enterprise)*,
 Dreadnought*
</p><p>
 Klingon Battlecruiser** (1-piece casting) Battlecruiser** (3-piece
casting)
</p><p>
<b>Task Force Games Starline 2200 ** </b>(out of production) all
intended for Star Fleet Battles (list is not exhaustive!)
</p><p>
 The Gamescience Federation range (under licence)
</p><p>
 Federation CV, CL, NCL, FF
</p><p>
 Klingon Tug, C9 Dreadnought, Battlecruiser (3-piece casting),
D5 Lt Cruiser, B-10 Battleship (SuperDreadnought),F-5 Frigate(actually
smaller)
</p><p>
 Romulan TOS Bird of Prey/Warbird (System Defence Boat), Condor

</p><p>
 Lyran -various
</p><p>

</p><p>
 Andromedan - various
</p><p>
 Hydran - various
</p><p>
Many of these are available as "Starline Limited Edition"
models, in the 2300 range below, but are not believed to currently
be in production. Other SFB models, sch as the Romulan Seahawk,
Kzinti Tug and so on are only available in the Limited Edition
range.
</p><p>
<b>FASA</b> (out of production)
</p><p>
 Federation Enterprise (pre-refit), Enterprise(post-refit), Reliant,
Destroyer (size of a Cruiser at least!), Tsiolkovsky, Excelsior
</p><p>
 Klingon B-12(?) Dreadnought/Carrier?, D7 Battlecruiser (stripped-down
version, as in the films, with exterior detail), D10(?) Battlecruiser
(very  large cruiser or small battleship), L7(&gt;?) Destroyer
(light cruiser size, with apparent hanger door), E5(?) Frigate
(Light cruiser size)
</p><p>
 Ferrengi cruiser
</p><p>
<b>Task Force Games Starline</b> 2300*** (list not exhaustive,
and range is growing)
</p><p>
 Federation Heavy Cruiser (different mold, warp nacelles somewhat
slimmer than previous models), NCL
</p><p>
 Romulan TOS Bird of Prey (Cruiser size, larger model than the
2200 one)
</p><p>
 Klingon Battlecruiser (1-piece model, different nose to previous
version)
</p><p>
 Tholian Patrol Craft (different mold)
</p><p>
 
</p><p>
<b>Unknown ***</b>
</p><p>
 Enterprise-D ( with detachable saucer, and last model I saw was
$129....)
</p><p>
 
</p><p>
<b>MicroMachines**** </b>
</p><p>
 Enterprise (pre-refit), Reliant (about 3% larger than the FASA
one, but quite OK), Botany Bay
</p><p>
 Klingon Battlecruiser (5% larger than the others), Vor'Cha attack
Cruiser
</p><p>
  
</p><p>
<b> Out of scale models</b>
</p><p>
 The MicroMachines also include a number of ships significantly
too big/small for inclusion, except as different classes of vessel
from the one  they're supposed to be. This includes:
</p><p>
 1/100,000-ish Borg Ship
</p><p>
 1/20000-ish  Romulan TNG Warbird
</p><p>
 1/7000-ish Excelsior
</p><p>
 1/300-ish Klingon Bird of Prey, Romulan TOS Bird of Prey
</p><p>
 And Starline 2200 also had
</p><p>
 1/300-ish Romulan TOS Bird of Prey
</p><p>
 
</p><p>
Now, on to the rules. The best known, and coincidentally, best-documented
class is that of the NCC-1701 USS <i>Enterprise.</i> Therefore,
when the conversion to FT is performed, this class will be done
first, and the rest of the Federation Fleet (and others) shoehorned
into using the resultant conversion methods.

For comparison purposes, the Mk VIII <i>Saladin</i> class Destroyers
weighed in at 95,000 t, the Mk VII <i>Hermes</i> class Scouts
at 94,500, the Mk VI <i>Ptolemy</i> class Tugs at 126,500, and
the Mk X <i>Federation</i> class Dreadnought at 285,000 t. More
on these later.
</p><h2>Full Thrust Conversion Rationale</h2>

<h3>Size</h3>

<p>
The Enterprise is described as a Heavy Cruiser, in both SFB and
the Articles of Federation. It would therefore be aesthetically
pleasing to keep her as a (Heavy) Cruiser in FT. This means a
size of 36 or less. All other FT interpretations of the Enterprise
that I've seen are based on a very literal transciption of the
 SFB StarShip Designs (SSDs), and result in large, Capital ships.
Similarly, ST Destroyers should be FT Destroyer sized, and the
ST Dreadnought an FT Capital ship, rather than a Supership.
</p><p>
Given a deadweight tonnage of 190,000, dividing it by 5500 gives
35.45 - call it 36. A Very Heavy Cruiser, but a Cruiser. OK so
far, but how does this compare with the others? 
</p><p>
Destroyers - 95,000 t  - 17.27, call it 18. A large Escort, but
an Escort nonetheless.
</p><p>
Scouts - 94,500 t - 17.18, call it 17.
</p><p>
Tugs - 126,500 t - 23 - standard light Cruiser or Merchant
</p><p>
Dreadnoughts - 285,000 t - 51.8, call it 52; a reasonable  Dreadnought
sized (large Battleship/Small Battledreadnought) Capital ship.
</p><h3>Systems</h3>

<p>
In the TV series, we only ever see 2 phaser beams, and single
torpedos being used. This is a good thing, because there's no
way to fit 6 beams of any reasonable size and two torpedo systems
onto a Cruiser Hull! The firing arcs of each battery, <i>pace
</i> SFB, appear to be mutually exclusive: what one twin battery
can fire at, another cannot. In addition, Captain Kirk never says
"Fire the Chin Phasers", he only says "Fire Phasers".
When the Phaser Banks are KO, it's an all or nothing affair -
we never have the port phasers knocked out, either the phaser
banks (plural) are OK, or not.
</p><p>
So 3 banks of twin phasers firing in mutually exclusive directions
can plausibly be interpreted as two beams, each with a port-fore-stbd
firing arc.
</p><p>
Similarly, the twin photon torpedos need to be interpreted as
a single torpedo system in FT.
</p><p>
OK, let's see what we have:
</p><p>
2 A class Beams (triple arc) Mass 6
</p><p>
1 Torpedo system Mass 5
</p><p>
Why Class A Beams? Frankly, so that the <i>Enterprise </i>is not
under-armed in comparison with other FT cruisers. The Torpedo
system gives a small advantage against the heaviest screens, compared
with its equivalent mass in beams, but not that much. 2 A class
and a Torpedo seems quite reasonable, even a touch on the light
side.
</p><p>
We've used up 11 of our 18 budget already. Add a level 1 screen
(mass 3) and we have 4 left over. Which is rather fortunate, as
we have no point defence (PDAF) or area defence (ADAF) yet. Add
one PDAF and one ADAF and we've used up the whole of the budget.
Alternatively, we could add a PDAF and beef up the screens to
level 2. Finally, the Enterprise, if no other of her class, should
have an extra Damage Control Party (DCP) if using <b>More Thrust
</b>.
</p><p>
Given that fighters play no part in the TV series, and that the
<i>Enterprise</i> is primarily a research vessel often used for
transporting high-value urgent cargoes, it is plausible that the
basic Class IX  Constitution Class has either 4 spare space, or
the extra shields and one spare space. Considering the difficulty
the <i>Enterprise </i>had with an Orion highly-manoeuverable small
craft (fighter?) and the larger Tholian patrol craft (a small
target), it is also more probable than not that the original class
IX had no anti-fighter defences whatsoever. Yet her shields seem
rather better even than the later NCC-1701A - they certainly are
able to be raised faster than appears on "The Wrath of Khan".
In the TV series she takes quite a lot of Disruptor fire with
only minor damage. Given that two additional batches - the Mk
IX a "BonHomme Richard" and Mk IX b "Achernar"
appeared afterwards, I have interpreted them as differing mainly
in the anti-fighter armament. Mk IX has Shield 2, and one spare
space (used for research). Mk IX a has shield 2 and a PDAF. Mk
IX b has Shield 1, a PDAF and an ADAF. These are probably not
additional beams or missiles as such, but are additional fire
control equipment and batteries to allow the unused phaser banks
to fire low-energy pulses at small targets.
</p><p>
Parenthetically, the ADB came up with remarkably similar reasoning
and armament when it added the "+" refits (SFB R2.70)
and Command Cruiser. Oh yes, and Enterprise may have received
an upgrade to IX a standard during the TV series, when the uniforms
changed, amongst other things. It is nearly universally the practice
 that current combat ships receieve a major rebuild called the
"Mid life upgrade" about halfway through their career,
and a number of significant alterations every few years in any
event.
</p><h3>Speed</h3>

<p>
The<i> Enterprise</i> is renowned for its high speed. I originally
gave it aspeed of 6, more in keeping with a Light Cruiser than
a heavy one, but as the Destroyers and Scouts have an identical
Warp Speed according to the Technical Manual, it's not unreasonable.
However, I've been pursauded that 4 is more appropriate, at least
for the rest of the class. After all, there's only one Scotty.

</p><h3>Refits</h3>

<p>
Although not strictly TOS, the refit of the Enterprise in the
first movie do provide a base for further adaptation to later
eras. Various sources make a good argument for the Enterprise
having received a refit to <i>BonHomme Richard</i> standard during
the TV series - the Uniforms changed, for one thing. The major
refit that ocurred though - corresponding exactly to the widespread
practice of doing a rebuild of a ship called the "mid-life
refit" , was to add an additional 6 individual phasers, and
to lighten her by 15,000 tonnes. This can be best simulated by
a variant of the Achenar - shrink her by mass 2, and replace the
ADAF with a 3-arc B Beam. The PDAF and B-Beam represents the dual-role
abilities of the additional single phasers rather than the co-ordinated
specialised anti-ship punch of the phaser banks, according to
PSB sources.

<p>
2. Expenditure is also granted under these articles of Federation
for the procurement or construction of such lesser classes of
space forces as shall be required to support Star Fleet operations
and the Heavy Cruiser class of Starships. These may be, but not
neccessarily limited to, types such as Scouts, Destroyers, Transports,
Re-Supply, Shuttlecraft, and Survey Ships.
</p><h3>"Saladin" Class Destroyers</h3>

<p>
NCC 500-519 of the Mk VIII <i>Saladin</i> class were authorised
by the original Articles of Federation in 0965. Another batch,
NCC 520-529 of the Mk VIIIa <i>Siva </i>class were authorised
in 3030, and the final batch, NCC 530-555 of the Mk VIIIb <i>Cochise
</i> class in 4699.
</p><p>
There is a difficulty with Federation Destroyers. According to
the SFTM, they have an identical armament to the Heavy Cruisers,
differing only in their physical dimensions, and range (9 years
instead of 18). How to deal with this?
</p><p>
Firstly, we'll downgrade the A class beams to B class. Due to
lack of power, or lesser Fire Control. Then we'll delete the shields.
FT escorts rarely have shields in any event, and the power has
to come from somewhere! In Star Trek, every ship, even merchants,
have some minimal shielding. We'll just count this as "shield
level zero", and leave our destroyer as a classic "eggshell
armed with a hammer".
</p><p>
Given the complete lack of anti-fighter armament of the original
design, it would be reasonable to suppose that the later versions
would remedy this. The Mk VIIIa deletes some of the phasers for
a fighter self-defence capability, the Mk VIIIb the torpedos as
well for an ADAF fit and beefed up screens
</p><p>
The result is:

The ADB had a similar problem in SFB. Their solution resulted
in a class of ship that was defensively good, but unable to make
full use of the torpedos it carried. The ADB also formulated no
less than three different anti-fighter-armed variants, the DE,
DDL, and DDG. The intent of this article was to get away from
the entirely SFB-based FT conversions, but the basic sources are
the same, so the results will be similar. The VIIIb corresponds
to a DE or DDG, and the 
</p><p>
VIIIa to a DDL, (sort of!).
</p><h3>"Hermes" Class Scouts </h3>

<p>
NCC 588-600 of the Mk VII <i>Hermes</i> class were authorised
under the original Articles of Federation in 0965. Batch II, NCC
601-616 of the Mk VIIa <i>Monoceros </i>class were authorised
in 3669. The final batch, NCC 617-625 of the Mk VIIb <i>Cygnus
</i> class differed from the others in being specially outfitted
as command and diplomatic couriers.
</p><p>
The armament of the lowly Scout is confined to a single double-bank
of phasers, capable of firing only in the forward arc, a cut-down
version of  the very similar Destroyer. Add Supeior Sensors and
an Area ECM fit, and it fits neatly.
</p><p>
By cutting down the phasers (but improving the Fire Control) we
can add a minimal fighter defence, and get an improved Mk VIIa
class. Finally, with the courier version we can increase speed
and add a Cloak, at the expense of adding some cargo space and
deleting all of the EW equipment.

<p>
NCC 3801-3815 of the Mk VI <i>Ptolemy </i>Class Tug/Transports
were authorised by the original Articles of Federation in 0965.
In 3640, NCC 3816-3830 of the Mk VIa <i>Keppler </i>class were
authorised. Finally, in a truly massive shipbuilding programme,
NCC 3831-3933 of the Mk VIb <i>Doppler</i> class were authorised
in 4990. 
</p><p>
These Tugs are used in conjunction with the Mk I NCC-1000 series
Liquid, Mk II NCC-2000 series Dry Bulk, Mk III NCC 3000 series
Refrigerated Goods, NCC 5000 series Mk V Products  and NCC 4000
series Mk IV Starliner pods, the last self-propelled at sublight
velocity in case of emergency. In passing, the standard ST Shuttlecraft
 is designated as Mk XIIb. Mk XI does not appear to be mentioned
anywhere. The Mk VI also, by its "Tug/Transport" designation,
appears to have some stand-alone cargo capacity. It is also designated
as a "Class I Starship", so is to full military rather
than commercial standards (ie it is not a merchant). The tug itself
is 126,500 t. Mk I, II and V pods are each of 121,566 t, the Mk
III is 100,000 t, and the Mk IV 80,000t deadweight, that is, empty.
Cargo load of the bulk pods is about 100,000 t. This corresponds
to a size of 61 when loaded with one pod, 100 with two pods, and
23 empty.
</p><p>
Armament consists of a pair of phasers in the familiar chin position,
and two other phaser pairs port and starboard. This corresponds
to 2 beams, each with 2 arcs. Because the ship is nearly the size
of a cruiser, and in the interests of making her a Fighting Ship
rather than a pure Cargo lugger, A class beams seem appropriate.
The later batches would first trade off a little of the 3 spare
internal cargo space for some anti-fighter defence, then more.
</p><p>
 
</p><p>
Thus we have:

</p><h3>"Federation" Class Dreadnought</h3>

<p>
NCC 2100-2119 were all authorised in 6066.
</p><p>
These have 10 phasers instead of Enterprise's 6, and a designed
safe cruise of Warp Factor 8, Emergency speed of Warp Factor 10.
However, things never turn out right, and the Mk X is "still
under construction" according to the SFTM. The firing arcs
of the phasers are difficult to model, too. However, 2 lots of
3-arc and 2 lots of 2-arc seem about right. By decreasing the
2-arc ones to B instead of A, or increasing tonnage slightly,
room could be provided for anti-fighter defence without refit
for the first time.

</p><h2>Klingons - "Battlecruiser"</h2>

<p>
The SFTM is silent about all the other races. The only primary
source material are the Klingon Battlecruiser Blueprints, and
the TV series. In the TV series, Klingon ships are described as
firing "disruptors" rather than phasers. The Special
Effects emission of a disruptor looks remarkably like that of
a photon torpedo, though the effect is indistinguishable from
a phaser. As for size, since the Klingon Battlecruiser is described
as just that - a Battlecruiser - it would be nice if it were a
Capital ship. Alas, it is not to be. The models of Klingon Battlecruisers
are  barely larger than Federation Destroyers, and are significantly
smaller than the <i>Enterprise</i>. Worse, by making  them "small
Capitals" rather than Cruisers, they become very expensive
indeed - too much so, in fact. No, I'll let the Klingon propagandists
describe them as Battlecruisers, but they're actually Heavy Cruisers,
and of average size for that class of vessel.
</p><p>
As for the Blueprints - I don't remember the tonnage given on
them ( 180,000? ) but three things stand out. Firstly, there are
phasers absolutely everywhere, in every conceivable place. With
spectacularly terrible firing arcs, unless one is firing backwards.
There are no less than 12 if memory serves. Secondly, there is
a gratuitous missile system, which has never been hinted at in
the TV series, or for that matter, the movies. Finally, and most
importantly, THERE WERE NO TOILETS. The old joke had it that this
was the reason Klingons got REALLY mean after only a few months
of a 5-year mission. "Where's the next pit stop, Koloth,
my back fangs are swimming!" "Only a few more Light
Years, Korax".
</p><p>
OK, so we have 12 "Phasors". 4 lots of 3-arc beams seem
about right. In the TV series, the disruptor effects always start
at the head of the boom, so we'll make that lot a bit chunkier
than the rest - A class rather than B.  Considering the dire effects
of the <i>Enterprise</i>'s weaponry even from a single salvo,
a level 1 screen seems about right. And let's say the Missiles
in the blueprints are a PDAF and ADAF combination.
</p><p>
Let's see... 1 3-Arc A-Beam, 3 3-Arc B Beams, Screen-1, PDAF,
ADAF, this is starting to look awfully familiar.... Yes, we have
just re-invented the Standard Heavy Cruiser, as appearing in 
<b>Full Thrust</b>.

</p><h2>Romulans</h2>

<p>
The Romulans appear with two different ship technologies: Firstly,
a small Sub-Light vessel with a Cloaking Device, and a spectacularly
powerful "Plasma Torpedo".  Secondly, and later on,
with "Lend-Lease" Klingon ships. The Klingon ships never
fire, but the Sub-Light vessel most certainly does, with awesome
effect. So let's leave the Klingon ship nearly untouched - delete
the PDAF and ADAF, and add a cloak.
</p><p>
As for the Bird of Prey, again, the Primary sources consist only
of the TV series, and a set of Blueprints.
</p><p>
Basically, the Blue prints take a Ginormous great weapon, build
a small section on top for the crew (of 12!), then bolt on a few
warp drives on the side, and you have it. The Romulan Bird of
Prey is a weapon with a ship built around it, rather than a ship
with a weapon installed. It is of Escort size.at best. Alas, the
presence of the Warp Drives directly contradicts the TV series,
where the whole point about the Romulan was that it was Sub-Light.
The fact that the story is basically the same as that of classic
WW2 Submarine vs Destroyer battles is irrelevant.
</p><p>
The Plasma Torpedo of the TV series is undoubtedly best modelled
by the Spinal Mount Nova Cannon - aka the Futtock Gun. Alas again,
this is only available for Capital ships, and the TV ship is definitely
of escrort size.
</p><p>
A final complication occurs in that there are three very different
models available for the TOS Bird of Prey. The standard Starline
2200 one, the same size as a Frigate, the Starline 2300, consistent
with the SFB WarEagle/WarBird, and a MUCH larger model, bigger
than the Enterprise.
</p><p>
Taking all of the above into account,. the best that I can come
up with is to have three different "Birds of Prey".
A small one, with a "Mini-Nova" or Wave Gun, a cruiser
sized one, and a large (Capital class) one with a full-blown Nova
Cannon. All fully comply with the rules, without modification,
but none completely corresponds with the TV series, nor with the
Blueprints. The Small one comes pretty close to the TV series
though, and is extremely effective.
</p><p>
Either have them as 3 different ship classes - System Defence
Boat, Cruiser, Battleship - within the same fleet, or pick the
one you like best.

</p><h2>Tholians</h2>

<p>
The only Tholian ship that appears in the original series is a
"Patrol Craft". This is a small escort - probably smaller
than even the Starline 2200 miniature is appropriate for. FT has
no rules for Webs (which seem to be most effective against a ship
already stationary) and they don't fire. They are easily crippled
though.
</p><p>
I have therefore gone out a bit on a limb here. To me, the most
significant thing about a Tholian PC is that it can immobilise
things if it gets to short range. Given the size of the only available
miniatures, the best solution is to make a relatively fragile
ship, with Needles. These are short range, and quite capable of
taking out the manoeuvre drive of even a SuperDreadnought. It
has to be an escort, and one of about size 12 to match the model.
The resultant design is my "best guess" at a Tholian
without changing rules, which is consistent with the miniature.

</p><h2>Orions</h2>

<p>
An Orion ship appears exactly once: as a very fast moving object,
that attacks by "ramming" repeatedly. It's appearance
is remarkably similar to the all-purpose Photon Torpedo effect,
and when it fails, it spectacularly suicides. It's too fast to
hit with normal phasers.
</p><p>
How the HECK does one model this? The answer is quite simple.
What in FT a) Cannot be hit with normal Beams 2) Moves fast, and
is incredibly manoueuverable 3) Has a limited number of attacks
4) Has to get real close to the target.
</p><p>
Obviously it's a fighter. When you have no PDAF or ADAF, and no
C beams, you just gotta sit there and take your lumps.
</p><h2> Gorns</h2>

<p>
The final race hostile to the Federation that makes an appearance
in TOS are the Gorns. Gorns appear (in the episode <u><i>Arena
</i></u> ), but their ships don't. So the primary source just
isn't enough.
</p><h1>Summary</h1>

<p>
That covers all of the primary source material - the TV series,
the Technical manual, and the Blueprints. But there's a host of
other ST models available, both for the Federation ( CL, CV, NCL,
FF ) and other races. Not only the SFB-based ones, either. <b>FASA
</b>also produced a host of new models for the Star Trek Role
Playing Game (STRPG) and Star Trek Battle Simulator (STBS). These
can be converted using similar techniqes, but that is best covered
in another article.
</p><p>
The ship designs that came out of this process are all quite reasonable.
The Klingon Battlecruiser turning out to be a standard FT Heavy
Cruiser is a piece of Serendipity, but the Federation stuff emphasises
the Torpedo, but is otherwise quite conventional. And the Small
Bird of Prey is an excellent Systems Defence Boat, while the large
one is pretty much an archetypical minimalist Nova ship. None
of the designs would appear out-of-place against the standard
designs in FT and MT. So dust off those Starline 2200 miniatures,
and go for it!
