Megabattery
-----------

Research and development sometimes produces advancement in battery technology resulting in longer-range and more devastating weapons systems. The greater cost in mass and points means fleets with access to this advanced technology will nonetheless be seen mounting these batteries in few numbers, at smaller classes, and with narrower firing arcs.

A longer-range and more devastating weapon system than the [standard battery](BeamBattery).

Rolling to Hit
--------------

| Range      | Class 1  | Class 2  | Class 3  | Class AA
| -----      | -------- | -------- | -------  | --------
| **0-18″**  | Roll 1D6 | Roll 2D6 | Roll 3D6 | Roll 4D6
| **18-36″** | ---      | Roll 1D6 | Roll 2D6 | Roll 3D6
| **36-54″** | ---      | ---      | Roll 1D6 | Roll 2D6

Rolling for Damage
------------------

| Hit Roll | Unscreened | One Screen | Two Screens
| :------: | ---------- | ---------- | -----------
| 1-3      | ---        | ---        | ---
| 4        | 1D6 damage | ---        | ---
| 5        | 1D6 damage | 1D6 damage | 1D6 damage
| 6        | 2D6 damage | 2D6 damage | 1D6 damage

Design Procedure
----------------

The cutting-edge technology used in megabatteries cost more in points and take up more mass on a ship.

| Type of System  | Mass | Cost
| --------------- | :--: | ----
| Class 1 Battery | 2    | 3 points + 2/arc
| Class 2 Battery | 5    | 5 points + 4/arc
| Class 3 Battery | 8    | 6 points + 5/arc
