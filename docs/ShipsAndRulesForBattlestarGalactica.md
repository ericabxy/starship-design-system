SHIP STATS for BATTLESTAR GALACTICA
-----------------------------------

Opinions regarding the dramatic and scientific virtues of
"Battlestar Galactica" may vary, but what cannot be denied is that
there's lots of space battles in the show -- which makes it perfect
for Full Thrust fans. What follows are ship designs for the major
warships seen on the screen, plus a few others that come from a
variety of sources (mostly my imagination).

My versions of the Colonial and Cylon ships are based on a few
assumptions that, in turn, were developed from what was shown in
the series. I have not used novels, comics or fanfiction as
references. These assumptions, which I freely admit are open to
challenge, are:

1. The weapons shown in the series are very powerful. Ships can
suffer a _lot_ of damage from a few hits. This may be because of
the highly volatile fuel that both sides use. Because of this, and
also because Adama's order for "Positive Shields" only ever seemed
to cause a blast shield to be lowered over the bridge viewport, I
have not given any ships screens or armour.
2. Weapons are also short-ranged, or so it would appear from the
few ship combat scenes (as distinct from those involving fighters).
This is almost certainly a result of a wish to show both sides on
the screen at the same time (the Star Trek stationary battle
syndrome), but I have interpreted it as implying that most beam
weapons would be no larger than B batteries in FT terms. A ship may
have a long-range or heavy weapon, but these would be few in number
(generally only one per ship).
3. Fighters are the primary long-range weapon of both sides.
Based on their representation in the show, I have defined Vipers as
Fast fighters and Cylon Raiders as Attack fighters. A capital ship
of either side is thought to hold a lot of fighters -- in "The Hand
of God", Tigh mentions that a Base Star carries 300 fighters, and
his comment that the Colonials will be outnumbered 2 to 1 is
evidence that the Galactica can carry at least 150, and probably
more, although this figure is slightly contentious in fan circles.
In any case, 100+ fighters is far too many to represent
individually in an FT ship -- the Base Star would mass at least
600! -- so I have chosen to let an FT fighter Group stand for a
Colonial or Cylon Squadron. The Galactica's fighter wing is not
outnumbered in FT terms by comparison with a Base Star's
complement, but that can be thought of as allowing for the lousy
shooting of the Centurions..! :-)
4. Since fighters are so important, fighter defences will be
equally so. However, even the Galactica does not seem able to
provide cover for the rest of the Fleet other than by drawing the
fire of attacking Cylons and by engaging incoming Raiders with its
Vipers. This I take to indicate that it lacks any form of area
defence (ADAFs in FT terms), which makes sense because Battlestars
would seem to be designed to be able to operate without
"conventional" escort ships (certainly none were ever seen in the
series).

Other ship classes that might be added, particularly if gamers want
to simulate battles from the Cylon War rather than those of the
series, include minelayers/sweepers and a whole gamut of smaller
classes. With the importance of fighters in the BSG universe, most
warships of any size (say, cruisers and up in FT terms) will carry
at least one Group. It might be useful to allow half-Groups (MASS
3, 3 dice/attack) in order to allow more flexibility in designing
smaller ships.

Most of the Colonial Fleet will be unarmed merchant ships, of all
shapes and sizes, pressed into service as transports for the
fleeing survivors

And finally, for those people who adore big guns, the deadly
Ravishol Pulsar, the super-weapon from the episode "The Gun On Ice
Planet Zero", can be represented in FT terms by an enhanced Wave
Gun, i.e., a weapon which uses the Wave Gun rules but does double
damage or even more (bringing it up to Nova Cannon levels or
beyond, but with the need to charge up and the single-turn firing
concept). This should not be considered as a ship-mounted weapon
(not in the BSG universe. anyway).

A miniature of the Galactica is available from Comet Miniatures in
the UK. Unfortunately, it looks to be based on that appalling model
kit that Monogram released (they got the Base Star right -- how
come they messed up the Galactica?), but it's all we got. Comet
also sell a Viper and a Raider, but no Base Star. All are
approximately 2-3" long. Some of the GZG/CMD fighters could be
modified to produce reasonable facsimiles of the BSG fighters that
are rather more in scale with ship miniatures, or even the model
kits: NSU heavy fighters make quite good Raiders if you cut their
noses off; Vipers could be made from several of the fighter types
(such as NAC or FSE fighters) but the conversion will be more
involved. The Fleet was a hodge-podge of whatever ships were
available at the time, so anything is suitable for use as a
freighter. Their vulnerability and sheer numbers (the consensus in
BSG fandom is that there are around 200 ships in the Fleet) could
make for a boring game (not to mention a large one!), so ship
miniatures could represent groups of ships much as fighter groups
do (although the damage capacity of a group would be considerably
larger).

And now, the ships:

### COLONIAL BATTLESTAR

MASS: 100

Mass for Fittings: 50

Damage Points: 50

Component  |  MASS Used | Cost

Hull       |          - |  200
FTL        |          - |  100

DC Party x 3       |  - |   30
-------------------|----|-----
Total              | 50 |  985

Notes:
1. This design is intended to be a generic representation of the
Colonies' major capital ships and is specifically based on the
Pegasus. The Pulse Torpedo is my attempt to portray the Pegasus'
missiles since FT missiles are too large (massive) to be provided
in the numbers seen on TV. Individual ships of this class may well
have greater or smaller variations from this layout -- they
probably will, since Battlestars are reputedly anything up to
hundreds of yahrens/years old, and will presumably have been
refitted many times.
2. Gamers wishing to play out the adventures of the Pegasus after
the events of the episode "The Living Legend" should remember that
the ship now only has 3 squadrons of fighters.


### BATTLESTAR GALACTICA

MASS: 100

Mass for Fittings: 50

Damage Points: 50

Component  |  MASS Used | Cost
-----------|------------|-----
Hull       |          - |  200
FTL        |          - |  100

DC Party x 3        | - |   30
--------------------|---|-----
Total              | 50 | 1015

Notes:
1. The Galactica has been modified from the standard battlestar
configuration in two major ways: firstly, the ship was never seen
to use missiles, even in direct combat with a Cylon Base Star, so
the Pulse Torpedo has been replaced by a more powerful beam weapon;
and secondly, to reflect its post-Destruction role as sole
protector of the Fleet and the few surviving humans, its fighter
defences have been increased. ADAFs might have been of more use,
but Adama's operational doctrine -- putting his ship in harm's way
in order to protect the vulnerable Fleet -- seems to indicate that
the Galactica cannot protect other ships with its fighter defences.
2. Two fighter Squadrons (Blue and Silver Spar) are ACEs.
3. The Galactica carries an extra Squadron of fighters (Silver Spar
Squadron from the Pegasus) that it was not designed to carry
normally. To reflect this, the ship has been given the extra
Squadron, but MASS has not been allocated for the launch bays. The
Galactica may only launch 2 Squadrons at one time, as per the FT
rules, and the remaining Squadrons must wait until the next
game-turn before launching. Players may decide that the fifth
Squadron must wait one or more further game-turns before launching
since the ship does not have dedicated facilities for it.


### COLONIAL GUNSTAR

MASS: 82

Mass for Fittings: 41

Damage Points: 41

Component  |  MASS Used | Cost
-----------|------------|-----
Hull       |          - |  164
FTL        |          - |   82
Normal Space Drive |    |
   Thrust = 4      |  - |  328
B(2) x 4           |  8 |   28
Wave Gun x 1       | 10 |   30
PDAF x 6           |  6 |   18
Fighters (F) x 2   | 12 |   64
Superior Sensors   |  2 |   30
ECM, Area Effect   |  3 |   30
DC Party x 3       |  - |   30
-------------------|----|-----
Total              | 41 |  804

Notes:
The Pulsar-class Gunstar was created by James M Stevenson. His
excellent drawings of both classes, available in GIF form from his
web pages ([URL](http://www.snm.com/~jstevens/ships/)) show the
Gunstar to be slightly smaller than a Battlestar. From these
drawings and its designation, I have assumed that the ship carries
a powerful beam weapon akin to the Ravishol Pulsar. A Wave Gun
seemed to be the best bet to represent such a weapon -- ship-borne,
and thus necessarily smaller than its planet-mounted counterpart --
in FT terms, and the rules for its use match well with what was
seen of the Pulsar's operation in that episode. Adama would _love_
to have one of these, and I have included it for those gamers who
might like to play battles from the Cylon War rather than limiting
themselves to post-Destruction scenarios.


### COLONIAL FLEET DEFENCE SHIP ("Flakship")

MASS: 40

Hull Type: Q-ship

Mass for Fittings: 20

Damage Points: 10

Component  |  MASS Used | Cost
-----------|------------|-----
Hull       |          - |   60
FTL        |          - |   40
Normal Space Drive |    |
   Thrust = 4      |  - |  160
B(3) x 1           |  2 |    9
C(2) x 4           |  4 |   16
PDAF x 2           |  2 |    6
ADAF x 4           | 12 |   40
-------------------|----|-----
Total              | 20 |  331

Notes:
If the Colonial Fleet did have, or developed, something like an
ADAF, then the _second_ thing that they would do (after refitting
the Galactica) would be to find one or more large freighters and
fit them out to defend against Cylon attacks. Operational doctrine
would require "squadrons" of Fleet ships to cluster around each
flakship when attacked.


### COLONIAL FLEET ARMED TRANSPORT

MASS: 50

Hull Type: Merchant

Mass for Fittings: 5

Damage Points: 13

Component  |  MASS Used | Cost
-----------|------------|-----
Hull       |          - |   75
FTL        |          - |   50
Normal Space Drive |    |
   Thrust = 2      |  - |  100
C(3) x 1   |          1 |    5
PDAF x 1   |          1 |    3
ADAF x 1   |          3 |   10
-----------|------------|-----
Total      |          5 |  243

Notes:
This is a less extreme version of the flakship -- a typical Fleet
ship, modified to carry as much defensive armament as it can
without compromising its main priority, which is to transport as
many survivors as possible in at least tolerable conditions. Gamers
may like to experiment with different weapons arrangements: an
extra C-battery and some PDAFs replacing the ADAF, for instance (if
you choose to assume that the Fleet doesn't have ADAF technology,
or even if they do). Losing the area defence capability will make
these ships' lives rather more exciting, because they will have to
encourage Cylon attacks on themselves in order to use their
weapons..!


### CYLON BASE STAR

MASS: 100

Mass for Fittings: 50

Damage Points: 50

Component  |  MASS Used | Cost
-----------|------------|-----
Hull       |          - |  200
FTL        |          - |  100
Normal Space Drive |    |
   Thrust = 4      |  - |  400
A(4) x 1   |          3 |   16
B(3) x 4   |          8 |   36
PDAF x 5   |          5 |   15
Fighters (A) x 5   | 30 |  130
Enhanced Sensors   |  1 |   15
ECM, Area Effect   |  3 |   30
DC Party x 2       |  - |   20
-----------|------------|-----
Total      |         50 |  962

Special Rules for Base Star:
Being circular, this ship doesn't really have a bow or stern, so
certain rules regarding the rear arc of a standard FT ship are
suspended. The Base Star will have a Velocity and Course as normal,
and all usual movement rules apply. However, some beam batteries
may fire into its "rear" arc. It should be noted that the Base
Star's two "mega-pulsars" (as described by Colonel Tigh in "The
Hand of God") are represented by the single A-battery. If you
wonder why almost everything is in fives, well, that stems from the
five-fold symmetry of the FX models.


### CYLON TANKER

MASS: 80

Hull Type: Merchant

Mass for Fittings: 8

Damage Points: 20

Component  |  MASS Used | Cost
-----------|------------|-----
Hull       |          - |  120
FTL        |          - |   80
Normal Space Drive |    |
   Thrust = 2      |  - |  160
PDAF x 2           |  2 |    6
Fighters (A) x 1   |  6 |   26
-------------------|----|-----
Total              |  8 |  392

Notes:
This ship is the tanker seen in the series pilot, found by Apollo
and Zac after it has refuelled the Cylon Raiders before their final
attack on the Colonial Fleet. Examination of the FX model has
forced me to include fighters, but I feel that a full Group is
really too many and makes the ship rather too massive for its
depiction in the show. A "half-group" of fighters (MASS 3, 13
points) would reduce the overall MASS of the ship to 50, which
seems more reasonable.Cylon
