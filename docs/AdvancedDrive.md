Advanced Drives
---------------

Advanced drive systems work just like [normal drives](NormalSpaceDrive), but are allowed to apply all thrust in _any direction_ regardless of current heading. Maneuvering in this manner is more versatile, as a normal drive must first change heading, apply forward thrust, and turn again to bring weapons to bear. An advanced drive can immediately apply thrust in the desired direction and turn only once to bring weapons to bear.
