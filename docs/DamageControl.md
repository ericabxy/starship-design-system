Damage Control
--------------

Damage control factors---also known as Damage Control Parties---are capable of repairing ship systems damaged by [threshold checks](ThresholdCheck). This can represent individual damage control parties or anything else appropriate for the background setting. Ships have a number of damage control factors available depending on the size of the crew and the number of hull boxes remaining.

A vessel has one damage control party per 8 remaining hull boxes, rounded up. You can allocate one, two, or three damage control parties to each system disabled by THRESHOLD damage. Systems damaged by [needle strike](NeedleSystem) cannot be repaired by DCP.

Assign a 1-3 damage control factors to each eligible system and roll one die for each system. Extra parties increase the chances of success.

| On a roll of... | 1 DCF Assigned  | 2 DCF Assigned  | 3 DCF Assigned
| :-------------: | --------------- | --------------- | --------------
| 1-3             | ---             | ---             | ---
| 4               | ---             | ---             | System repaired
| 5               | ---             | System repaired | System repaired
| 6               | System repaired | System repaired | System repaired

Damage control factors are an integral feature of a ship's crew and internal systems. They need not be marked on a ship diagram and aren't rolled for during threshold checks, but losing hull boxes reduces the number of DCF you have available.
