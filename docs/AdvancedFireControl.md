Advanced Fire Control
---------------------

This is an improved version of the standard [fire control system](FireControlSystem) representing the latest in long-range, high-resolution detection technology. A single advanced FireCon can act as two standard FireCons; it can target two separate enemy ships, target one ship for [battery](BeamBattery) fire and the same or another ship for [torpedo](TorpedoSystem) fire, and so on.

An advanced FireCon can also scan targets farther out than a standard FireCon for certain detection purposes. While a standard system is limited to 54&Prime; (which may limit certain weapon systems if they have a range longer than 54&Prime;!), this system can reach 72&Prime; for tracking, scanning, and targeting purposes.

Lastly, this advanced targeting system allows [advanced weapon batteries](AdvancedBattery) to operate in special fire modes, namely [needle mode](AdvancedBattery#needle-mode) and [area defense mode](AdvancedBattery#area-defense-mode).

_Todo:_ Should this system allow [main batteries](MainBattery) access to more accurate firing modes?
