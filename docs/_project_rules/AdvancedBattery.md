Advanced Battery
----------------

A major development in offensive technology results in weapons batteries that are more accurate and reliable at range.

Range and Rolling to Hit
------------------------

An advanced battery has a maximum range and rolls a number of [beam dice](BeamDice) to hit. The number of dice doesn't fall off at longer ranges like standard batteries.

| **'L'** class | Out to **48″** | **ONE** die
| **'M'** class | Out to **24″** | **TWO** dice
| **'C'** class | Out to **12″** | **FOUR** dice

Point Defense Mode
------------------

ANY class of advanced battery may be used for point defense exactly as effective as a single [point defense system](PointDefenseSystem), but limited to the arcs it can normally fire through. In this mode it does NOT require a [FireCon](FireControlSystem) for targeting, but it cannot be used in anti-ship mode in the same turn.

Each advanced battery fired in point defense mode rolls ONE die, and the attacking group suffers losses as follows.

| Every **1**, **2**, or **3** rolled | No losses
| Every **4** or **5** rolled         | Group loses **one** craft
| Every **6** rolled                  | Group loses **two** craft

Design Procedure
----------------

| Arc of fire | Mass | Cost
| ----------- | :--: | ----
| 60&deg;     | 2    | 10 points
| 180&deg;    | 3    | 15 points
| 360&deg;    | 4    | 20 points
