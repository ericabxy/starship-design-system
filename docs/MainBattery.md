Main Battery
------------

This system represents a ship's principle offensive weaponry; the standard ship-to-ship weapons of whatever fiction the ship lives in. A single battery can represent several mounted barrels, emitters, or turrets working in tandem; or a single turreted weapon with one or more barrels/projectors. It is less effective at long range due to accuracy of firing solutions, spread of the individual projectiles/rays, etc. It can be partially countered by expensive [defense technology](ScreenGenerator) that can absorb, disrupt, or deflect incoming missiles/beams.

Rolling To Hit
--------------

See [Range and Bearing](RangeAndBearing) for details on how to find direction and distance to targets.

To determine the effect of firing on a target, a number of dice are rolled depending on range. Class-3 batteries have a maximum range of 36&Prime;. When firing at a range of 0-12&Prime;, three dice are rolled; at 12-24&prime;, two dice; and at 24-36&Prime;, one die. The following table shows the number of dice to roll indexed by battery class and range to target.

|              | **0-12″**    | **12-24″**   | **24-36″**   | **36-48″** | **48-60″**
| ------------ | :-------:    | :--------:   | :--------:   | :--------: | :--------:
| **Class-1**  | **ONE** D6   | ---          | ---          | ---        | ---
| **Class-2**  | **TWO** D6   | **ONE** D6   | ---          | ---        | ---
| **Class-3**  | **THREE** D6 | **TWO** D6   | **ONE** D6   | ---        | ---
| **Class-4**  | **FOUR** D6  | **THREE** D6 | **TWO** D6   | **ONE** D6 | ---
| **Class-5**  | **FIVE** D6  | **FOUR** D6  | **THREE** D6 | **TWO** D6 | **ONE** D6

Unscreened Damage
-----------------

Damage is dealt according to the results of the dice. The target ship must cross off a number of <span class='hull-boxes'>j</span>hull boxes according to the total damage points generated as detailed in this table.

| Every **1**, **2**, or **3** rolled | No effect
| Every **4** or **5** rolled         | **One** damage point
| Every **6** rolled                  | **Two** damage points

Damage Protected by Screens
---------------------------

Defensive [screens](ScreenGenerator) reduce the damage from beam batteries.

| **Level-1 Screens** | Rolls of **4** have no effect
| **Level-2 Screens** | Rolls of **6** inflict only **one point** of damage

Class-1 Point Defense Mode
--------------------------

Class-1 beam batteries can be fired in defense against approaching small craft and missiles. This requires the use of one [fire control](FireControlSystem) system, but this one can be shared among any number of Class-1 batteries being used in point defense mode.

1D6 is rolled as normal, but only one hit is scored on a roll of **5** or **6** (as if being affected by level-2 screens).

Class-2 Needle Mode (experimental)
----------------------------------

At a range of 9&Prime;, a Class-2 battery can target and knock out a ship's systems. This requires the dedicated use of a [FireCon](FireControlSystem), and to determine the effect roll *one D6*.

**Needle Mode Effects:**

| Roll results | Effect
| ------------ | ------
| 1-3          | No effect
| 4-5          | One damage point
| 6            | One damage point AND target system knocked-out

Penetrating Damage
------------------

Ships using these design rules tend to have far fewer hull boxes than the revised rules (see Fleet Book 1), so standard batteries do **not** re-roll sixes to deal extra damage in this game.

Lore
----

The main battery in these documents represents whatever ship-to-ship weaponry is extant in the fiction the vessel lives in. It could be a directed-energy weapon or a particle accelerator---like a _laser beam_, a _phaser beam_, or a _particle beam_. It could be something more mundane like _high-velocity projectiles_ or other _ballistic missiles_.
