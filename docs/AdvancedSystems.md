Technology Levels
-----------------

Advanced versions of certain ship systems are provided to allow for "tech level" differences between major players in this system. The difference between standard systems and advanced systems are designed not to be simple "power-ups"; each advanced technology is designed to be fundamentally different in some way.

The advanced systems allow you to flavor the field of battle with players that have a slight or distinct edge over the others. Some standard Earthlings might be waging war against an alien enemy with extremely maneuverable gravity drives, for example.

When to Use Advanced Ship Systems
---------------------------------

Advanced systems are used to add unique flavor to certain conflicts, usually to make "alien" forces feel fundamentally different from standard "human" technology levels. For example, a faction might use [railguns](RailgunSystem) as their primary ship-to-ship weapons. To compensate for the narrower firing arcs, they developed [advanced drive systems](AdvancedDrive) to maneuver their weapons to bear more easily, and to top it all off they employ [advanced screens] to defend against their own powerful projectile weapons.
