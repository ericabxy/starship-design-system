Submunitions
----------

A submunition system is a one-shot package of short-range missiles, designed to pack a punch at a lower cost than heavier multi-use weapon systems.

Firing submunitions generates damage by rolling a number of dice depending on range to target.

| At range of...
| ---------- | ---
| **0-6″**   | Roll **three** D6
| **6-12″**  | Roll **two** D6
| **12-18″** | Roll **one** D6

Damage is determined similarly to beam batteries, but submutions are _unaffected_ by [defensive screens](ScreenGenerator).

| Results                             | Damage
| ----------------------------------- | ------
| Every **1**, **2**, or **3** rolled | No effect
| Every **4** or **5** rolled         | **One** damage point
| Every **6** rolled                  | **Two** damage points

After being fired, a submunitions system cannot be used again during the battle. You must cross off its symbol on the ship system display.
