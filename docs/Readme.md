Introduction
------------

_Full Thrust_ is a sci-fi wargaming rule system with simple procedures for designing balanced starships and conducting various space combat and operation scenarios. Players design their starships and compose fleets, then test their capabilities in gameplay scenarios.

Ship Design
-----------

Constructing a ship follows some fast and simple design rules: you choose the size of hull you want to work with, then proceed to cram as much _space stuff_ as you can inside it. See the [ship design rules](ShipDesignProcess) for details.

Gameplay
--------

The game is played on a flat surface where distances are measured freehand. Using a hex grid is possible if desired but underdeveloped at this time. Many actions are resolved by rolling a number of six-sided dice (or "D6") and reading the results. See the [gameplay rules](Gameplay) for details.
