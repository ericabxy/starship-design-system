Introduction
------------

_Full Thrust_ is a sci-fi wargaming rule system with simple procedures for designing balanced starships and conducting various space combat and operation scenarios.

### Design

The ship design system centers around the concept of a generic MASS unit allowing you to know exactly how much technology you can fit on a certain size and class of ship. Even before playing, you can review the [ship design rules](ShipDesign) to get a feel for what kinds of starships you can field during gameplay.

### Gameplay

The game is played on a flat surface a few feet to a side and ships can move and interact with each other based on a standard unit of measurement (typically inches). The outcomes of various decisions (especialy firing weapons if in a combat scenario) are determined by rolling and reading six-sided dice (or "D6").
