Welcome to the starship design system
-------------------------------------

The Starship Design System is a collection of rules based on _Full Thrust_ allowing for fast and simple ship construction and gameplay challenge.

Hull Design
-----------

Construction starts with choosing the [size of hull](HullDesign) you want to work with. This helps determine the overall cost of construction and gives you a total volume of mass available for fitting ship systems.

### Normal Space Drive

The [normal space drive](NormalSpaceDrive) is a vessel's primary means of propulsion.

### Main Battery

Warships have a complement of [main batteries](MainBattery) for ship-to-ship combat.

### Faster-than-light Drive

For interstellar travel, ships can be fitted with a [faster-than-light drive](FasterThanLightDrive) system allowing entry into jump space or hyperspace.

### Screen Generator

Ships with enough mass to spare can be fitted with [defensive screening](ScreenGenerator) systems that deflect and dampen incoming fire.
