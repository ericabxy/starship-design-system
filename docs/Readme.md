This is a space ship design system based on the tabletop wargame _Full Thrust_. Simple procedures are defined for designing balanced starships and conducting operations in space.

Ship Design
-----------

Constructing a ship follows fast and simple design rules. See the [ship design process](ShipDesignProcess) for details, [ship designs](Categories#ship-designs) for examples, or you may be looking for a list of [ship systems](Categories#ship-systems) available for fitting.

Gameplay
--------

The game is played on a flat surface where distances are measured freehand. Using a hex grid is possible if desired but underdeveloped at this time. Many actions are resolved by rolling a number of six-sided dice (or "D6") and reading the results. See the [gameplay rules](Gameplay) for details.
