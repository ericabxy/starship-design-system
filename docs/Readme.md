Introduction
------------

_Full Thrust_ is a sci-fi wargaming rule system with simple procedures for designing balanced starships and conducting various space combat and operation scenarios. Players design their starships and compose fleets, then test their capabilities in gameplay scenarios. Review the [ship design rules](DesignProcess) to get a feel for what kinds of starships you can field.

### Gameplay

The game is played on a flat surface a few feet to a side and ships can move and interact with each other based on a [standard unit of measurement](RangeAndBearing) (typically inches). The outcomes of various decisions (especialy firing weapons if in a combat scenario) are determined by rolling and reading six-sided dice (or "D6")---typically either "[beam dice](BeamDice)" or "[projectile dice](ProjectileDice)" depending on the situation.
