Missile Craft
-------------

Missiles are small, fast, unmanned spacecraft with combat payloads and onboard A.I. that can pursue and attack capital ships.

Launching
---------

A missile is launched just like a fighter.

Moving
------

Move up to 18" each turn, within 60 degrees of the missile's current heading, for up to THREE turns. 

Attacking
---------

If any ships end their movement within 3&Prime; of an enemy missile, the missile will attack the nearest enemy ship. The ship's [point defense](PointDefenseSystem) systems may attempt to shoot down the missile before it hits.

The missile is heavily armored and is treated as if it has Grade--2 defensive screens.

| Roll results | Effect
| ------------ | ------
| 1-4          | No effect
| 5-6          | Missile destroyed

Design Costs
------------

### Missile Rack

A missile rack contains 1 flight of missiles and once it has launched, must be crossed off the SSD for the rest of the battle.

__Mass:__ 2

__Cost:__ 6

### Missile Launcher

A missile launcher serves to fire multiple flights of missiles, one flight per turn. The supply of missiles is stored in an internal magazine.

__Mass:__ 2 and an additional +1 for every missile in the magazine.

__Cost:__ 6 and an additional +3 for every missile in the magazine.

Probes
------

Instead of a warhead, missiles can be designed to carry other systems even for non-combat purposes. For example, a sensor platform that can get close to ship or other body and send back data that the launching ship couldn't sense at that range; or a message bouy or beacon to be intercepted by another ship or use stationkeeping thrusters to remain in place for another ship to discover.

### Dummy Probe

A dummy probe emits a signature that makes it register on passive sensors as an ESCORT size ship. It remains in play until it is actively scanned, revealing its true nature and removing it from the table.

Original Rules
---

### More Thrust

Launch directly forward

Move immediately up to 18" with an optional 60-degree turn at the mid-point of this move.

Attack any ship within 6" and NOT in the rear arc (90-degree arc).

When attacking, may be fired on by PDAF and ADAF with only rolls of 6 killing it. LIKE A LEVEL-3 SCREEN.

2D6 damage. LIKE TWO TORPEDOES

### Fleet Books

Use 3" range for vector movement.

Rear arc is 60 degrees.

### Continuum "Multi-stage Heavy Missiles"

Launch in a 180-degree arc.

Place between 16" and 24" inches within that arc.

If no ship can be targeted, on second turn replace the missile between 16" and 24" from original position within 60 degrees of its own heading.

When not attacking, missile may be fired on by fighters and ADFC.

PDS kills the missile on a roll of 5 or 6. LIKE HEAVY FIGHTERS

Fighters and Class-1 batteries kill on rolls of 6 only. LIKE PDS IN ANTISHIP MODE

Fighters have a 1-in-6 chance of dying if it kills a missile.

Attack 3" in ANY direction.

3D6 damage. LIKE THREE TORPEDOES
