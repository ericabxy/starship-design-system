Missile Craft
-------------

_Note: These rules are in-development._

Missiles are small, fast, unmanned spacecraft with combat payloads and onboard A.I. used to pursue and damage capital ships.

Launch and Movement
-------------------

### Launching Turn

Move missile group up to 18&Prime; in a direction within a 60&deg; arc centered on the heading of the launching ship.

### Subsequent Turn

Move missile group up to and additional 18&Prime; in a direction within a 60&deg; arc centered on its current heading.

Attacking a Target
------------------

### Making an Attack Run

The missile group makes an attack run on the nearest enemy ship within 3&Prime; of it. At this point the ship's [point defense](PointDefenseSystem) systems can attempt to shoot it down before it strikes true.

### Point Defense

A standard missile group is represented by a number of effective warheads each of which will deal 1D6 damage if they hit. Point defense fire has a chance to destroy some or all of this destructive power before the attack run completes.

Experimental 2D6 missile rules:

| Every __1__, __2__, __3__, __4__, or __5__ rolled | No losses
| Every __6__ rolled                                | Group loses __one__ missile and __reroll__ for the other

Experimental 3D6 missile rules:

| Every __1__, __2__, __3__, or __4__ rolled | No losses
| Every __5__ rolled                         | Group loses __one__ missile
| Every __6__ rolled                         | __Two__ missiles killed

### Resolving an Attack Run

If any missiles survive point defense fire, they strike the ship and deals 1D6 damage per remaining missile. Damage ignores standard [screens](ScreenGenerator), but is affected by any [advanced screens](AdvancedScreen) defending the ship.

Design Costs
------------

A missile system is fitted to the hull and contains 1 flight of missiles. Once it has launched, must be crossed off the SSD for the rest of the battle. Each system costs 6 points and takes up 2 mass.

Advanced Missiles

Notes
-----

The rules for missile craft are meant to be an interesting single- and multi-turn projectile weapon, as well as provide options for settings that don't include "fighter"-size craft---a sci-fi concept that is considered unrealistic or undesirable in some cases!
