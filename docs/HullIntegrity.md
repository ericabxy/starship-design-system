Hull Integrity
--------------

After choosing a hull size its time to cost it according to how effective it is against damaging effects like collisions, space "terrain" effects, and combat. The base cost is 1 point per MASS of the hull (mass is equal to hull size).

The hull costs additional points based on how many hull boxes it will have. The number of hull boxes represents a ship's structural integrity i.e. the amount of damage it can take before essential systems are compromised. The ship must have at least 25% of its overall mass in hull boxes, and each hull box costs an additional 2 points. The maximum amount of hull boxes---representing military grade materials, compartmentalization, redundancy, etc.---is 50% of overall mass. For example, a 32 MASS heavy cruiser hull would have 16 hull boxes and cost 64 points; 1 &times; the mass of the hull for 32 points, and 2 &times; the number of hull boxes for another 32 points.

Advanced Hull Integrity
-----------------------

At an increased cost hulls can be reinforced or insulated in such a way that more damage can be taken before essential systems are affected. This is more common with smaller ships like escorts and cruisers. Hulls with advanced integrity arrange their hull boxes in fewer rows than standard.

| Hull Boxes | Cost
| ---------- | ----
| 2 rows     | 4 points per box
| 3 rows     | 3 points per box
| 4 rows     | 2 points per box

Notes
-----

These documents standardize on the "merchant" ship design rules outlined in _Full Thrust_. The choice between military and civilian ship is now mostly a matter of buying less than 50% of overall mass in hull boxes and filling 40% of the space for systems with [cargo space](CargoSpace). Optional rules allow for the creation of stronger hulls (with fewer hull rows), and a system to allow for cheaper thrust ratings in smaller hulls is being considered.
