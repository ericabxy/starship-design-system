Hull Integrity
--------------

The number of hull boxes represents a ship's hull integrity i.e. the amount of damage it can take before essential systems are compromised. Military ships employ the latest in materials, compartmentalisation, redundancy, etc. resulting in "superior"-strength hulls giving them the maximum number of hull boxes possible (50% of overall ship mass). "Merchant" and other civilian ships have access to less military-grade technology and materials resulting in "average"-strength hulls; 25% of mass in hull boxes is the typical amount of damage points a non-military ship can take.

Fewer hull rows == more damage taken before reaching a threshold.
