_Notes:_

As a large structure, this space station has 10 rows of hull boxes (the normal 4 rows, plus 1 more row for every 50 mass beyond 100). Both of its types of cargo space are divided into 10 to reflect this, so hold space is destroyed in proportion to hull boxes. The hangar bays are rolled for at threshold points.

Fighter groups (12 craft in total) are serviced by a flight crew of 24 pilots and twelve technicians who fly formation and simulation exercises 4 days a week. The crew is rotated out every four months by the dreadnought battle squadron stationed 2 light years away in the Baffin system.

Point defense lasers are fitted in case of attacks or raids, but are mostly used to vaporize meteorites and other space debris. Submunitions are available to deter any bold raiders and are tested on practice targets once a week. These are resupplied every four to six months from Baffin as well.

Hangar bays see regular weekly traffic and there's often at least one SMALL freighter or liner docked for a few days stay, but larger ships must keep station some distance away and send shuttles.
