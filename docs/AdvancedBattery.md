Advanced Battery
----------------

Technologically advanced batteries use a cutting-edge beam technology that's effective at longer ranges and do more damage. The high-powered generators and focusing systems, however, are more expensive to produce and take up more mass than standard batteries.

### Range and Hit Rolls

| Range  | Class 1  | Class 2  | Class 3  | Class AA
| ------ | -------- | -------- | -------  | --------
| 0-18″  | Roll 1D6 | Roll 2D6 | Roll 3D6 | Roll 4d6
| 18-36″ | ---      | Roll 1D6 | Roll 2D6 | Roll 3d6
| 36-54″ | ---      | ---      | Roll 1D6 | Roll 2d6

### Damage

| Hit Roll | Unscreened | One Screen | Two Screens
| :------: | ---------- | ---------- | -----------
| 1-3      | ---        | ---        | ---
| 4        | One hit    | ---        | ---
| 5        | One hit    | One hit    | One hit
| 6        | Two hits   | Two hits   | One hit

For _each hit_ scored, roll another D6 and consult the following table to determine the damage dealt.

| Damage roll
| ----------- |
| 1-2         | **One** damage point
| 3-4         | **Two** damage points
| 5-6         | **Three** damage points

Point Defense Mode
------------------

Much like [standard batteries](BeamBattery), advanced batteries can operate in point defense mode. Any

Design Costs
------------

The cutting-edge technology used in advanced beam batteries cost more in points and take up more mass on a ship.

| Type of System  | Mass | Cost
| --------------- | :--: | ----
| Class 1 Battery | 2    | 3 points + 2/arc
| Class 2 Battery | 5    | 5 points + 4/arc
| Class 3 Battery | 8    | 6 points + 5/arc
