Rolling to Hit
--------------

| Range      | Class 1  | Class 2  | Class 3
| -----      | -------  | -------  | -------
| **0-12″**  | Roll 1D6 | Roll 2D6 | Roll 3D6
| **12-24″** | ---      | Roll 1D6 | Roll 2D6
| **24-36″** | ---      | ---      | Roll 1D6

Rolling for Damage
------------------

First determine the number of hits scored:

| Hit Roll | Unscreened   | One Screen   | Two Screens
| :------: | ----------   | ----------   | -----------
| 1-3      | ---          | ---          | ---
| 4        | **One** hit  | ---          | ---
| 5        | **One** hit  | **One** hit  | **One** hit
| 6        | **Two** hits | **Two** hits | **One** hit

For _each hit_ scored, roll another D6 and consult the following table to determine the damage dealt.

| Damage roll
| ----------- |
| 1-2         | **One** damage point
| 3-4         | **Two** damage points
| 5-6         | **Three** damage points

Point Defense Mode
------------------

Much like [standard batteries](MainBattery), advanced batteries can operate in point defense mode. In the case of this system in particular ANY class of advanced battery can be fired in this way, it rolls for hits as a SINGLE [point defense system](PointDefenseSystem) using the unmodified table, and does NOT require a [FireCon](FireControlSystem) dedicated to its target.

| Results...
| Every 1, 2, or 3 rolled | No hits
| Every 4 or 5 rolled     | One fighter or missile killed
| Every 6 rolled          | Two fighters or missiles killed

An advanced battery used in this mode cannot by used in anti-ship mode in the same turn. It follows the same rules as a normal PDS against tougher enemies like [missile craft](MissileCraft), [heavy-type fighter groups](FighterGroup#heavy-fighters), etc..

Needle Strike Mode
------------------

To be determined once Advanced Fire Control systems are added.

Area Defense Mode
-----------------

To be determined once Advanced Fire Control systems are added.
