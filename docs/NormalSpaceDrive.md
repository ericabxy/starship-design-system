Normal Space Drives
-------------------

A ship's "normal space" drive system accelerates it to combat speeds and allows it to execute tactical maneuvers. A normal drive is rated by the amount of thrust it can output in one turn. Each unit of thrust represents the ability to accelerate the ship 1&Prime;.

During the movement phase, the normal drive can accelerate the ship forward any number of units at a cost of one thrust per 1&Prime;. The ship can also spend one thrust to rotate the ship to any clock face heading. Finally, one thrust can be spent to "push" the ship sideways exactly 1&Prime; and backward exactly 1&Prime;, but no more than that. Every thrust spent comes out of the total thrust available in the turn, which cannot be exceeded.

Design Procedure
----------------

__Mass:__ A ship's normal drive is part of the 50% reserved for essential systems, so it does not cost any additional mass like other systems do. _Experimental:_ A normal drive is limited to a maximum thrust rating of __8__.

__Points Cost:__ Every one unit of thrust costs a number of points equal to the ship's total mass.

__Experimental:__ Since a ship's normal drive takes two threshold failures or needle strikes to be fully disabled, you can---if desired---record this as _two_ separate drive symbols on the ship diagram, each with _half_ the total thrust rating. The total thrust available per turn is equal to the total of each remaining operational drive symbol, and they are still targeted as a single system by threshold checks and needle attacks.
