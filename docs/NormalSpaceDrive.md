Normal Space Drive
------------------

A ship's "normal space" drive system accelerates it to combat speeds and allows it to execute [tactical maneuvers](ShipMovement). A normal drive is rated by the amount of thrust it can output in one turn. Each unit of thrust represents the ability to accelerate the ship 1&Prime;.

During the movement phase, the normal drive can accelerate the ship forward any number of units at a cost of one thrust per 1&Prime;. The ship can also spend one thrust to rotate the ship to any clock face heading. Finally, one thrust can be spent to "push" the ship sideways exactly 1&Prime; and backward exactly 1&Prime;, but no more than that. Every thrust spent comes out of the total thrust available in the turn, which cannot be exceeded.

Design Procedure
----------------

__Mass:__ A ship's normal drive is part of the 50% reserved for essential systems, so it does not cost any additional mass like other systems do. A normal drive is limited to a maximum thrust rating of __8__.

__Points Cost:__ Every one unit of thrust costs a number of points equal to the ship's total mass.

Notes
-----

A ship (or immobile installation) with no normal space drive system must be fitted with a power generation system and long-term life support systems, so it doesn't get any extra space like a ship without an [FTL drive](FasterThanLightDrive#non-ftl-ships) does. The non-propulsion power plant has no extra cost---it is included in the initial cost for the hull.
