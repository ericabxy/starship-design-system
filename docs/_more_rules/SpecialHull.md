Special Hulls
-------------

_Full Thrust_ and _More Thrust_ outlined a few different special cases where a hull could be fitted in different ways, including incredibly-large ships and incredibly-armed ships. Since these rules are standardizing on a single classification of ship hull, some changes need to be made to accommodate these special cases.

__Military:__ Warships that don't fit any cargo space can have up to 50% [hull integrity](HullIntegrity).

__Merchant:__ Civilian craft tend to fit the maximum allowed [cargo space](CargoSpace) (40%), and thus have the minimum hull integrity (25%).

__Dummies:__ A cheap ship fitted with a "dummy" bogey generator, or a [drone/probe](MissileCraft#drones) built for this purpose.

__Weasel Boats:__ A 'Weasel' decoy system can be fitted for 1 mass.

__System Defense Ships and Monitors:__ Any ship that doesn't fit an [FTL drive](FasterThanLightDrive) but still fits a normal space drive is allowed to fit a total of 75% mass in weapons and systems.

__In-system Freighters:__ Non-military ships without an FTL drive have room for 60% mass of cargo space. This of course limits them to 25% hull integrity.

__Tugs and Tenders:__ FTL tugs have towing capacity represented by [cargo space](CargoSpace). Tenders similarly have a lot of space for [hangar bays](HangarBay). Both of these designs may be limited to less than 50% [hull integrity](HullIntegrity) (minimum 25%).

__Starbases:__ Immobile space structures with no [normal space drive](NormalSpaceDrive) or [FTL](FasterThanLightDrive) use internal hull space for long-term life support and power generation systems. It must be fitted with a minimum of 10% of its mass in ship systems, up to a maximum of 50%. It can be fitted with up to 60% of its mass in [cargo space](CargoSpace) and [hangar bays](HangarBay) (the normal 40%, plus an additional 20% thanks to the space freed up by having no drive systems).


Space structures with no must make up for it with long-term energy and life support systems, so no space savings are made. The space saved by lacking an FTL drive should be reserved for hangar bays (up to 25% mass) or cargo space (20% mass).

__Space Installations:__ Structures bigger than 100 mass should have a fifth hull row and bigger than 150 should have a sixth, and so on.

__'Q' Ships:__ A [Q ship](HullIntegrity#q-ship) is built on a hull that has no more than 25% hull integrity.

__Superships:__ Mobile ships should be limited to 100 mass, but if needed the drive system still costs 1 &times; hull size per thrust rating. Only required to fit one [FireCon](FireControlSystem). Hull rows should increase per 50 mass over 100.
