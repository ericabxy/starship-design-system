Civilian Systems
----------------

Ship systems available to civilian industry are generally not intended for warfare or combat. They do include some low-grade weapons systems, but civilians ships are mostly designed around transportation, storage, reconnaissance, mining, and demolition. In certain cases they'll be equipped for a minimal amount of defense against pirate raiders. Weapons and defenses like batteries and screen generators can double as tools for demolition and protection from celestial phenomena.
