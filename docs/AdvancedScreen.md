Advanced Screens
----------------

Advanced screens employ a type of "smart" or [reactive armor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_armour) designed to intercept and deflect physical projectiles. This makes them effective against weapons that normally ignore or punch through less advanced screens.

Against Batteries
-----------------

Advanced screens work as normal [defensive screens](ScreenGenerator) against [beam batteries](MainBattery) and [advanced batteries](AdvancedBattery).

Against Submuntions
-------------------

Advanced screens affect [submunitions](Submunitions) as if they were beams, taking fewer hits depending on screen level.

__Submunitions damage against advanced screens:__

| Results                                    | Screen Level 1        | Screen Level 2
| -------                                    | --------------------- | --------------
| Every __1__, __2__, __3__, or __4__ rolled | No effect             | No effect
| Every __5__ rolled                         | __One__ damage point  | __One__ damage point
| Every __6__ rolled                         | __Two__ damage points | __One__ damage point

Against Torpedoes
-----------------

Advanced screens do not affect the hit rate of [torpedoes](TorpedoSystem), but they do reduce the damage inflicted by successful hits.

__Torpedo damage against advanced screens:__

| Result       | Screen Level 1            | Screen Level 2
| ------------ | --------------            | --------------
| __1__ rolled | No effect                 | No effect
| __2__ rolled | __One__ damage point      | No effect
| __3__ rolled | __Two__ damage points     | __One__ damage point
| __4__ rolled | __Three__ damage points   | __Two__ damage points
| __5__ rolled | __Four__ damage points    | __Three__ damage points
| __6__ rolled | __Five__ damage points    | __Four__ damage points

Against Railguns
-----------------
Advanced screens reduce the chance of taking double damage from a [railgun](RailgunSystem#advanced-screens) hit.

__Railgun damage against advanced screens:__

| Screen Level 1 | 1-4 Rolled       | 5-6 Rolled
| Screen Level 2 | 1-5 Rolled       | 6 Rolled
| :------------: | ---------------- | ----------
| Class 1        | __One__ point    | __Two__ points
| Class 2        | __Two__ points   | __Four__ points
| Class 3        | __Three__ points | __Six__ points
| Class 4        | __Four__ points  | __Eight__ points

Relative Tech Level
-------------------

Advanced screens are meant to represent a major technological development in defense against conventional (and advanced) weapons; namely the explosive damage from torpedoes and missiles, and the kinetic penetrating damage of railguns, which normally "punch through" standard defensive screening technology.

There is no "super advanced" weapons technology represented in these rules that can in turn defeat advanced screens. If technology in the chosen background reaches such a point, it is suggested to readjust the relative technology available. For instance, militaries with advanced screens are downgraded to standard screens; ships that would have standard screens now don't mount any at all (the tech is ubiquitous but also obsolete); and explosives and kinetics that used to be stopped only by advanced screens are now standard batteries.

The rules are meant to represent the ever-evolving nature of research and development in warfare by facilitating an ever-shifting window of aging, current, and advanced technology.
