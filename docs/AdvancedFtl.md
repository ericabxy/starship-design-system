Advanced Faster-than-light Drive Systems
----------------------------------------

Some FTL technology is advanced to the point that ships using it do not suffer failure due to proximity to massive objects. A ship with advanced FTL behaves exactly as a ship with a standard [FTL system](FasterThanLightDrive), but when engaging FTL space during gameplay does not roll to determine drive failure; it simply disappears from the table successfully at the mid-point of its movement. Similarly, when entering the table from FTL flight, it arrives exactly at its planned entry point without rolling to determine deviation, and causes no ill effects from proximity to other objects (unless of course it proceeds to collide with something like an asteroid once in normal space).

There is room to experiment with relative technology levels when it comes to advanced drives. Under these rules as written, ships with advanced FTL systems can't do anything other than exit and enter the table more accurately and without any danger. It is still prohibited from engaging FTL when the battlefield is not agreed to be within a possible "jump point", such as within a star system or near a planetary body. But in scenarios _designed_ for ships to enter and exit FTL space (such as a race to reach the hyperspace limit before your pursuers can catch up to you), a difference between standard and advanced FTL drives could be declared to make things interesting.
