Spatial Distortion Missiles
---------------------------

Advanced missile system that causes damage to nearby ships entering [faster-than-light](FasterThanLightDrive) space. Placed up to 18&prime; from the firing ship in a 60&deg; or 180&deg; arc. [Point defense systems](PointDefenseSystem), fighters, and other defenses within 3&Prime; (also see Area Defense Systems) can attempt to "kill" the missiles before they detonate---treat it like a fighter group with three craft remaining.

The missiles are small craft, so the damaging effect of FTL entry is lower than that of larger craft. For each ship within 1&Prime; of the detonation point, roll a number of D6 equal to the number of missiles that survived point defense fire and deal the result in damage points to the ship. Then reduce the amount of dice by __one__ and repeat the roll for ships within 2&Prime; of the detonation point---unless there are no dice left. Reduce by __one__ again and repeat for ships within 3&Prime; if applicable.
