Screen Generator
----------------

Screens are electromagnetic field generators used to disrupt and dissipate incoming [beam battery](MainBattery) fire. Active screens reduce the damage scored by each [beam die](BeamDice) rolled.

**Beam battery damage against defensive screens:**

| Result     | Level-1 Screens       | Level-2 Screens
| ---------- | --------------------- | ---------------
| 1-4 rolled | No effect             | No effect
| 5 rolled   | **One** damage point  | **One** damage point
| 6 rolled   | **Two** damage points | **One** damage point

One defensive screen system generates a Level-1 screen. Two systems on the same ship generate a Level-2 screen. Any additional systems beyond two act as redundant generators, but protection cannot be increased beyond Level-2.

Defensive screens have no effect against incoming [railgun](RailgunSystem), [submunitions](Submunitions), or [torpedo](TorpedoSystem) fire.
