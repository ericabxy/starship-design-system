Pulse Dice
----------

Represents an explosion or other devastating damage like [torpedo hits](TorpedoSystem) or [missile strikes](MissileCraft). In this case you roll __one D6__ and the result is the number of damage points applied (from __1 to 6__ points). In other words, the results are applied thus:

| On a roll of...
| __1__ | __One__ point
| __2__ | __Two__ points
| __3__ | __Three__ points
| __4__ | __Four__ points
| __5__ | __Five__ points
| __6__ | __Six__ points

Circumstances can interfere with the damage dealt. In this case the results are graded.

|              | Pulse Grade −1   | Pulse Grade −2
| ------------ | --------------   | --------------
| __1__ rolled | No effect        | No effect
| __2__ rolled | __One__ point    | No effect
| __3__ rolled | __Two__ points   | __One__ point
| __4__ rolled | __Three__ points | __Two__ points
| __5__ rolled | __Four__ points  | __Three__ points
| __6__ rolled | __Five__ points  | __Four__ points

Halving the Results
-------------------

Sometimes the base damage is less devastating, and the dice are read as __one D3__.

|                       | D3 Result
|                       | ---------
| __1__ or __2__ rolled | __One__ point
| __2__ or __3__ rolled | __Two__ points
| __4__ or __6__ rolled | __Three__ points

In case a D3 is graded:

|              | D3 Grade −1      | D3 Grade −2
| ------------ | -----------      | -----------
| __1__ rolled | No effect        | No effect
| __2__ rolled | __One__ point    | No effect
| __3__ rolled | __One__ point    | __One__ point
| __4__ rolled | __Two__ points   | __One__ point
| __5__ rolled | __Two__ points   | __Two__ points
| __6__ rolled | __Three__ points | __Two__ points
