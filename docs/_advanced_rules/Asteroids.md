Asteroids
---------

Asteroids in these rules represent celestial bodies larger than the largest ships but smaller than planets, planetoids, and satellites. Unlike ships, which are considered to be small enough and operating at long enough ranges that they do not block line-of-sight or collide, asteroids are an obstacle and collision threat.

If any asteroid's base blocks line-of-sight between any two ships, those ships cannot target each other with direct-fire weapons and cannot perform sensor scans of each other.

If any ship's course intersects an asteroid's base by the end of movement, a single D6 is rolled to avoid a fatal collision by equaling or exceeding a difficulty number. The difficulty is equal to the ship's current velocity minus its current thrust rating. Failing this roll results in immediate loss of the ship and all hands.

Demolition
----------

If the scenario calls for it, the smallest asteroids have 50 "hit points" and the next size up have 100, and so on. If weapons fire manages to deplete an asteroid's hit points it breaks up into 1D12 smaller chunks with randomized courses determined by 1D12 and 1D6-3 (minimum 0) velocity. If the scenario is a situation that involves "mining" asteroids, modify these rules as needed (mining rules in-development).
