Projectile Dice
---------------

Projectiles represent a weapon that hits for the same amount of damage at any range. To determine whether it _does_ hit requires a 1D6 to-hit roll.

| At range of:
| **0-6″**   | Required score to hit: | **2** to **6**
| **6-12″**  | Required score to hit: | **3** to **6**
| **12-18″** | Required score to hit: | **4** to **6**
| **18-24″** | Required score to hit: | **5** or **6**
| **24-30″** | Required score to hit: | **6** only

The result indicates a _single_ hit, but the damage scored is determined by other means. For example, [torpedo systems](TorpedoSystem) use projectile dice, then inflict damage by rolling a separate 1D6.
