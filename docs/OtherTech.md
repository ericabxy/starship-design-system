Alternative Technology Mixes
----------------------------

The default state of these rules are malleable and can represent many different specific sci-fi properties, but they're still based on a rather rigid mix of relative technologies. For instance, the main batteries of ship are affected by the basic defensive system, but secondary weapons completely ignore them. If the main weapons of the universe are meant to be kinetic in nature, and are stopped by the defense system while other kinetics are not, discrepancies arise in the mix of technology used and the mechanics backing them. This is mitigated somewhat by the [advanced systems](AdvancedSystems) available on a case-by-case basis, but sometimes its be necessary to rebalance the entire technology and game mechanics base.

Belterverse
-----------

No hull armor. No screens. More rows of hull boxes. No FTL.

_Point Defense Systems:_ When used in anti-ship mode, PDS roll like Class-1 batteries out to 6&Prime;, and like interceptors out to 12&Prime;.

_Missiles:_ Smaller and cheaper. Three missiles cost 1 mass, and each does 1d6 damage if they hit.

_Fire Control:_ Must keep target within 54&Prime;

_Electronic Counter Measures:_ Work as limited defense against missiles.

Descendents
-----------

Weapons of war in this setting use a highly advanced "programmable matter" ammo system so although things look a bit like laser beams everything a ship fires is a projectile weapon. The "shields" in this setting are a form of "reactive armor" that intercepts and deflects the incoming projectiles.

For flavor, beams and normal screens are not used. Ships are fitted with a mix of [railguns](RailgunSystem) and [torpedoes](TorpedoSystem). [Advanced drive](AdvancedDrive) systems give them the maneuverability needed to aim and dodge firing arcs. [Advanced](AdvancedScreen) screen technology comes standard to defend against the weaponry in common use.

If some kind of energy weapon is introduced, it may be ruled that advanced screens in this setting do not defend against them since they are specifically designed to defend against kinetics.
