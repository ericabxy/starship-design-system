Ship Design Process
-------------------

| Ship Type | Hull Size
| --------- | ---------
| Courier   | 2-25
| Cruiser   | 20-50
| Freighter | 40-60
| Tanker    | 50-100

Constructing the Hull
---------------------

### Hull Size and Mass Factor

Choose a hull size between 2 and 100. This is the size of the ship and the total Mass factor.

Also see [atmospheric streamlining](AtmosphericStreamlining)

### Damage Points

An average ship has at least 25% [hull integrity](HullIntegrity), but this can be increased up to 50% with superior construction technology. However, superior hulls limit the amount of cargo space possible; more on that later.

Costing Drive Systems
---------------------

Space ships must be fitted with a [normal space drive](NormalSpaceDrive) for propulsion. An immobile starbase or space installation must instead be fitted with an appropriate power plant.

Many ships are fitted with a [faster-than-light drive](FasterThanLightDrive) system for interstellar travel. Non-FTL ships---like in-system freighters and system defense cruisers---save on space due to the absence of a drive and can be fitted with more weapons and systems.

Optional: Designating Cargo Space
---------------------------------

Depending on the hull integrity chosen above, up to 40% of the hull's overall mass (rounded down) can be made into [cargo and passenger space](CargoSpace). For every 1-5% hull integrity beyond the minimum 25%, there is 8% less space available for cargo and passengers.

[FTL tugs and tenders](FtlTugTender) are designed to "tow" other ships through FTL space. These hulls are fitted with special, oversize FTL drive systems to accomplish the task, but the space needed is taken out of the overall mass available for cargo space.

'Q' ships are civilian hulls fitted with military-grade combat systems. To accomplish this deceit, a merchant ship with the maximum amount of hold space is repurposed by installing weapons and defenses in its cargo holds. The resulting ship does not have military-grade hull integrity (it is average, 25%), but the maximum amount of hull is available for additional systems (50%).

Fitting Additional Systems
--------------------------

The hull has at least 10% of its mass available to fit additional systems, and can be fitted with up to 50%. Non-FTL ships can increase that to 75% in the absence of their FTL drive.

[Civilian systems](CivilianSystems) are generally available to fit to non-military ship hulls, while [military systems](MilitarySystems) are usually reserved for powerful war industries.

Example: Survey Cruiser
-----------------------

For example, lets design a ["survey cruiser"](CuriousClassSurveyCruiser) of mass 48. Our survey cruiser has 12 hull boxes (25% of total mass), a main drive rated Thrust-4, a faster-than-light drive, and one [fire control system](FireControlSystem).

The survey cruiser has 24 mass available to fit additional systems, and as a research ship let's reserve 19 of that for [science facilities](CargoSpace#science). The remaining 5 mass is enough room to mount a superior sensor platform (mass 2), two [point defense](PointDefenseSystem) systems (mass 2), and a single Class-1 [battery](MainBattery) (mass 1).
