title: Apocalypse class SUPERCARRIER
---

Designed in homage to the terrifying Cylon Basestar in _Battlestar Galactica_, I classed this ship a "supercarrier" because of its primary role in fielding an overwhelming fleet of fighters. Due to [Basestar statistics](http://www.tecr.com/galactica/capships/basestar.htm) found at the _Battlestar Galactica Technical Manual_, it's twice as massive as the [battledreadnought](CaravanClassBattledreadnought) and fitted with twice as many [fighter groups](FighterGroup).
