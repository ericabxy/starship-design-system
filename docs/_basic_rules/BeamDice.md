Beam Dice
---------

The term "Beam Dice" (BD) refers six-sided dice rolled and read according to the probability chart below. [Beam batteries](MainBattery) are the most common ship-to-ship weapon and combat is centered around rolling and reading dice in this standard way. The batteries deal an amount of damage by scoring a number of "hits", and each hit deals exactly **one** damage point. 

| Every 1, 2, or 3 rolled | No hits
| Every 4 or 5 rolled     | One hit
| Every 6 rolled          | Two hits

Using the same probability chart, other systems can do something else with "hits" for variety. For example [megabattery](MegaBattery) systems score a number of hits, but deal **1D6** damage points per hit. An EMP gun might deal no damage points, but induce threshhold damage at a level determined by the number of hits scored.

Degradation
-----------

The effectiveness of beam dice can be degraded to represent the effectiveness of defenses, or the ineffectiveness of lesser weapons. [Defensive screens](ScreenGenerator) reduce the amount of hits taken by beam dice to Grade --1 or Grade --2, and [point defense systems](PointDefenseSystem) are so poor at anti-ship fire that they hit at Grade --3.

|                | Grade 0  | Grade --1 | Grade --2 | Grade --3
| -------------- | -------- | --------- | --------- | ---
| Every 1 rolled | ---      | ---       | ---       | ---
| Every 2 rolled | ---      | ---       | ---       | ---
| Every 3 rolled | ---      | ---       | ---       | ---
| Every 4 rolled | One hit  | ---       | ---       | ---
| Every 5 rolled | One hit  | One hit   | One hit   | ---
| Every 6 rolled | Two hits | Two hits  | One hit   | One hit

Enhancement
-----------

Beam dice hits can also be enhanced to represent favorable conditions or specialized technology. [Attack fighters](FighterGroup#attack) employ ship-killing weapons and make attack runs at Grade ++2.

|                | Grade 0  | Grade ++1 | Grade ++2 | Grade ++3
| -------------- | -------- | --------- | --------- | ---
| Every 1 rolled | ---      | ---       | ---       | ---
| Every 2 rolled | ---      | ---       | ---       | ---
| Every 3 rolled | ---      | ---       | One hit   | One hit
| Every 4 rolled | One hit  | One hit   | One hit   | Two hits
| Every 5 rolled | One hit  | Two hits  | Two hits  | Two hits
| Every 6 rolled | Two hits | Two hits  | Two hits  | Two hits
