Hull Design
-----------

Ship construction starts with choosing a hull size. Typical ships range in size from 2 to 100. The MASS of the ship is equal to this size, and costs 1 construction point per mass.

### Structural Integrity

Next it is necessary to cost the hull's structural integrity. Integrity must equal at least 25% of total mass up to a maximum of 50% total mass. Greater structural integrity limits the amount of cargo and passenger space allowed in the hull.

### Damage Points

A ship gets an amount of DAMAGE POINTS equal to its structural integrity, and each DP costs 2 additional construction points. The amount of structural integrity determins how much damage the hull can take before needing a [threshold check](ThresholdCheck).

### Atmospheric Streamlining (Optional)

If the ship is intended to land on a planet's surface, it's necessary to streamline and reinforce the hull to survive atmospheric entry and flight. A hull can be PARTIALLY streamlined, costing additional construction points equal to 100% total mass; or FULLY streamlined costing an additional 200% total mass.

### Cargo and Passengers (Optional)

Better-than-average hull integrity limits the amount of mass available for [cargo and passenger space](CargoSpace). A hull is built with enough room to accommodate a crew and basic operations; but a hauler, tanker, science vessel, or passenger liner must have room for additional holds and quarters. For every 1-5% beyond average integrity the hull has, 8% less internal mass is available for cargo and passengers.

| Hull Integrity | Maximum Cargo Space
| -------------- | -------------------
| 25%            | 40% of hull mass
| 26-30%         | 32% of hull mass
| 31-35%         | 24% of hull mass
| 36-40%         | 16% of hull mass
| 41-45%         | 8% of hull mass
| 46-50%         | 0% of hull mass
