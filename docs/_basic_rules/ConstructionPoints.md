Construction Points
-------------------

Every ship costs an amount of points to construct, but you can actually spend an UNLIMITED amount of construction points on any one ship. However, when constructing a fleet you are often limited to a maximum combined points budget. For instance, an evenly-matched combat scenario might budget 750 points to each player; or a campaign might give you only 5000 points to spend on fleets to spread out among several star systems.
