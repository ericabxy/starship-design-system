Ship Movement Procedure
-----------------------

When a ship is "moved" it is allowed to make maneuvers according to its [main drive](NormalSpaceDrive) thrust rating, and then it is moved automatically according to its current velocity as outlined below.

A drive system can be used to maneuver by applying thrust in the direction of the ship's current heading---which must align with a clock-facing direction of 1 through 12. The drive can move the ship's CURRENT position along that heading UP TO a number of units&Prime; equal to its thrust rating.

The same drive system may also apply thrust to CHANGE the ship's heading. ONE unit of thrust can rotate the ship from any heading to any other heading, again in a clock-facing direction of 1 through 12. This can happen AFTER thrust is used to accelerate along the ship's heading, but only if at least one point of thrust was left unused for the drive to perform the rotation. Rotation can also occur BEFORE an application of thrust along the new heading, but any units of thrust used in the rotation or any previous maneuvers count against available thrust for any others.

Lastly, the drive system can also apply ONE unit of thrust sideways and ONE unit of thrust backward, but only one of EACH during an entire movement phase. This last maneuver likewise requires and uses up one unit of thrust available for all maneuvering in the turn.

Velocity
--------

All ships have a current velocity indicated by a secondary marker on the board. The marker is always placed at the ship's _previous_ position on the board, and indicates the direction and distance it's inertia is currently carrying it.

When it comes time for a ship to move according to its velocity (after all maneuvers have been made), it MUST be moved away from its velocity marker along a line intersecting both the velocity marker and the ship's current position, to a distance equal to the current distance between the velocity marker and the ship. Then the velocity mark must be moved to the ship's previous location to continue indicating its current velocity.
