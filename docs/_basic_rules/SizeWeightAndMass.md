Size, Weight, and Mass
----------------------

"Mass" is a generic unit in these rules that doesn't translate into any particular real-world unit of size, weight, or density. It need not even translate to relative size. For instance the _Constitution_-class HEAVY CRUISER and the _Miranda_-class ESCORT CRUISER may be roughly similar in internal volume, but the escort cruiser has a smaller power plant and a more compact hull and its entirely reasonable for it to have less MASS available for systems compared to the more capable heavy cruiser.
