Faster-than-light Tug/Tender System
-----------------------------------

This system is designed to extend a ship's FTL drive fields around another ship in order to "carry" it through FTL space.

Tug capacity is limited just like [cargo space](CargoSpace) to a maximum of 40% hull mass, and a hull with higher-than-average integrity (more than 25%) reduces this maximum as well.

Each 2 mass of FTL tug space grants 5 mass of FTL towing capacity and costs 10 points. Thus, a MASS 50 Tug with 20 space dedicated could tow a ship of up to MASS 50 through FTL space, and a MASS 60 Tender with 24 space could carry up to 60 mass of ships through.

__Note:__ Whether the ship diagram should show the _towing capacity_ for each portion of FTL tug space, or the _mass_ of each portion, is yet to be determined.

### Examples

- Mass 50 FTL Tug
- 1 &times; FTL drive system (0 mass, 50 points)
- 50 &times; FTL towing capacity (20 mass, 100 points)
- 12 &times; Hull integrity (0 mass, 24 points)
- 5 mass available for weapons/systems

- Mass 60 FTL Tender
- 1 &times; FTL drive system (0 mass, 60 points)
- 60 &times; FTL towing capacity (24 mass, 120 points)
- 15 &times; Hull integrity (0 mass, 30 points)
- 6 mass available for weapons/systems
