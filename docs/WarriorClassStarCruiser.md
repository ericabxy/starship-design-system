Based on the famous [Earth Federation fighting ship](https://atarihq.com/5200/manuals/starraid.html), the _Warrior_ class is a fast, maneuverable strike cruiser. Its torpedo launchers can fire in tandem at the same target, or engage two targets at once. Shorter-range photon weapons serve as its defense against missiles and fighters.
