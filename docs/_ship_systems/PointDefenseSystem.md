Point Defense System
--------------------

A point defense system (PDS) is an array of short-range weapons designed to target fast-moving, lightly-armored craft like fighters and missiles.

Rolling To Hit
--------------

A PDS is normally fired in defense when the fitted ship is under attack from [fighters](FighterGroup) or other groups of small craft. Roll ONE six-sided die for every PDS firing on one attacking group at a time.

### Table: Point Defense Check

| For each six-sided die...           | Result
| ----------------------------------- | ------
| Every __1__, __2__, or __3__ rolled | No losses.
| Every __4__ or __5__ rolled         | Target group loses __one__ craft.
| Every __6__ rolled                  | Target group loses __two__ craft.

Anti-ship Mode
--------------

A point defense system may be used to fire against other ships instead of small craft. It is limited to a range of 6&Prime;. A PDS used in this mode cannot be used in defense mode on the same turn, but a FireCon is NOT required to target the enemy ship. Each PDS fired rolls ONE six-sided die.

| Per six-sided die... | Result
| -------------------- | ------
| Every __1-5__ rolled | No effect
| Every __6__ rolled   | __One__ damage point

[Screen](ScreenGenerator) levels do not affect damage dealt by PDS fire.
