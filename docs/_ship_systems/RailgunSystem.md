Railgun System
--------------

Electromagnetic accelerator fires solid penetrators at high velocity. The chance to hit a target is the same as [torpedo systems](TorpedoSystem).

Range and Rolling To Hit
------------------------

| At range of... | Required score to hit
| -------------- | ---------------------
| 0-6″           |  __2__ to __6__
| 6-12″          |  __3__ to __6__
| 12-18″         |  __4__ to __6__
| 18-24″         |  __5__ or __6__
| 24-30″         |  __6__ only

For each railgun projectile that hits, damage is dealt equal to the class of the railgun. However there is a chance it will deal _double_ the damage instead. Roll another six-sided die to determine the result.

### Table: Railgun Damage

| Railgun Class  | 1-3 Rolled   | 4-6 Rolled
| :------------: | ------------ | ----------
|       1        | one point    | two points
|       2        | two points   | four points
|       3        | three points | six points
|       4        | four points  | eight points

\* Standard defensive screens do not affect damage dealt by railguns

Advanced Screens
----------------

While standard defensive screens do not affect railgun hits or damage in any way, [advanced screens](AdvancedScreen#against-railguns) are able to reduce the chance of taking double damage.

### Table: Railgun damage against advanced screens

| Screen Level 1 | 1-4 Rolled   | 5-6 Rolled
| Screen Level 2 | 1-5 Rolled   | 6 Rolled
| :------------: | ------------ | ----------
| Class 1        | one point    | two points
| Class 2        | two points   | four points
| Class 3        | three points | six points
| Class 4        | four points  | eight points
