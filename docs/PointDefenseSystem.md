Point Defense System
--------------------

A point defense system (PDS) is an array of short-range weapons designed to target fast-moving, lightly-armored craft like fighters and missiles.

Rolling To Hit
--------------

A PDS is normally fired in defense when the fitted ship is under attack from [fighters](FighterGroup) or other groups of small craft. One six-sided die is rolled per PDS.

| Every __1__, __2__, or __3__ rolled | No hits
| Every __4__ or __5__ rolled         | Group loses __one__ craft
| Every __6__ rolled                  | __Two__ craft killed

Anti-ship Mode
--------------

A point defense system may be used to fire against other ships instead of small craft. It is limited to a range of 6&Prime;. A PDS used in this mode cannot be used in defense mode on the same turn, but a FireCon is NOT required to target the enemy ship. Each PDS fired rolls ONE six-sided die.

| Every __1-5__ rolled | No effect
| Every __6__ rolled   | __One__ damage point

[Screen](ScreenGenerator) levels do not affect damage dealt.

Alternative Point Defense Fire (experimental)
------------------------------

Meant for low-tech settings where ships are very vulnerable to the simplest weapons. Not intended for use with main batteries or defensive screens in play.
