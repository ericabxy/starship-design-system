Needle System
--------------

A needle system is a short-range weapons array capable of tightly-focused, accurate fire. It can knock-out individual systems on a target vessel while causing minimal structural damage.

Targeting a system on an enemy ship requires one [FireCon](FireControlSystem), which can't be used to fire other non-needle systems this turn. It CAN however be used to fire other needles at the SAME target system this turn.

Range and Rolling To Hit
------------------------

The maximum range is __12&Prime;__. Designate a single system on the target ship and roll __one D6__ per needle firing.

| On a score of...
| :-:
| 6   | Target system knocked-out and one damage point applied to HULL
| 5   | One damage point applied to HULL
| 1-4 | No effect

A system knocked-out by needle fire cannot be repaired by [damage control](DamageControl). As with threshold checks, a [normal space drive](NormalSpaceDrive) must be knocked-out or damaged TWICE in order to completely disable it.

Needle systems are unaffected by [screens](ScreenGenerator) and armor.

Un-enhanced Needle System (obsolete)
-------------------------

An older version of the needle system was less effective.

At a range of __9&Prime;__, nominate one system and roll __one D6:__

| On a score of...
| :-:
| 6   | Target system knocked-out
| 1-5 | No effect
