Needle System
--------------

A needle system is a short-range weapons array capable of tightly-focused, accurate fire. It can knock-out individual systems on a target vessel while causing minimal structural damage.

Targeting a system on an enemy ship requires one [FireCon](FireControlSystem), which can't be used to fire other non-needle systems this turn. It CAN however be used to fire other needles at the SAME target system this turn.

Range and Rolling To Hit
------------------------

The maximum range is __12&Prime;__. Designate a single system on the target ship and roll __one D6__ per needle firing.

| On a score of...
| :-:
| 6   | Target system knocked-out and one damage point applied to HULL
| 5   | One damage point applied to HULL
| 1-4 | No effect

A system knocked-out by needle fire cannot be repaired by [damage control](DamageControl). As with [threshold checks](ThresholdCheck), a [normal space drive](NormalSpaceDrive) must be knocked-out or damaged TWICE in order to completely disable it.

Needle systems are unaffected by [screens](ScreenGenerator) and armor.

Multi-arc Needle System (experimental)
-----------------------

At extra mass and cost a needle system can be fitted to fire through up to 180 degrees of arc.

Design Procedure

|                | Bearing           | Mass | Cost
| ---            | :-----:           | :--: | ----
| _Standard_
|                |  60&deg; (1 arc)  | 2    | 6 points
|                | 120&deg; (2 arcs) | 3    | 9 points
|                | 180&deg; (3 arcs) | 4    | 12 points
| _Heavy Needle_
|                |  60&deg; (1 arc)  | 5    | 15 points
|                | 120&deg; (2 arcs) | 8    | 24 points
|                | 180&deg; (3 arcs) | 11   | 33 points

Obsolete Version
----------------

An older version of the needle system was less effective.

At a range of __9&Prime;__, nominate one system and roll __one D6:__

| On a score of...
| :-:
| 6   | Target system knocked-out
| 1-5 | No effect

Lore
----

Although it is a separate system on the ship diagram, needle systems can represent the ship's main battery being used in a more accurate mode to "call shots" as in "target engines only".
