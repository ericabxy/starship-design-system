Hangar Bay
----------

Ships are assumed to have minor intraship facilities included in the 50% of mass reserved for essential systems. This includes anything that has little relevance in combat; for instance personal shuttles and spacesuits do not need to be costed or tracked under the design rules.

Hangar bays for personnel transports, troop carriers, and other major craft on the other hand DO need to be accounted for during ship design and gameplay operations just like the rules for [fighter craft](FighterGroup). Space for craft is provided on a 1-to-1 basis e.g. two MASS 4 dropships can be accommodated by a single MASS 8 hangar bay. Spare space can be taken up by appropriately-sized small craft, even fighters, e.g. a MASS 6 bay could hold a MASS 3 lander and 3 fighters from a half-size fighter group.

__Minimum size:__ mass 6.

__Threshold checks:__ Each individual bay is rolled for as a separate system during threshold checks. Any craft inside a bay lost in this way are also destroyed or lost.

__Cost for interface craft:__ 2 points per MASS of craft e.g. the two MASS 4 dropships above cost 16 points total.

Cost for a hangar bay itself is paid separately from the interface craft.

| Size of bay | Cost
| ----------- | ----
| Mass 6      | 2 points
| Mass 7-12   | 3 points
| Mass 13-18  | 4 points
