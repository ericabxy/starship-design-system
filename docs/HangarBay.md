Hangar Bay
----------

Storage and launch facilities for small craft and interface craft. Space for craft is provided at a 1-to-1 basis e.g. two MASS 4 dropships are accommodated by a single MASS 8 hangar bay. Spare space can be taken up by appropriately-sized small craft, even fighters, e.g. a MASS 6 bay could hold a MASS 3 lander and 3 fighters from a half-size [fighter group](FighterGroup).

__Minimum size:__ mass 6.

__Threshold checks:__ Each individual bay is rolled for as a separate system during threshold checks. Any craft inside a bay lost in this way are also destroyed or lost.

__Cost for interface craft:__ 2 points per MASS of craft e.g. the two MASS 4 dropships above cost 16 points total.

Cost for a hangar bay itself is paid separately from the interface craft.

| Size of bay | Cost
| ----------- | ----
| Mass 6      | 2 points
| Mass 7-12   | 3 points
| Mass 13-18  | 4 points
