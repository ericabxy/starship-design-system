For my project I am building an introduction/reference website for a set of tabletop role-playing games. As of today I have finished the general layout, but I've made little progress on the transitions and animations. So far---as with any project---I find the most time-consuming process is deciding on layout and colors (some people call this "painting the bike shed").

I've found it much easier than ever to tackle responsive design early on, since I understand best practices like mobile-first and several ways to organize CSS. If I have one question, its what is the best approach to a collapsing text element? Should I put a button at the end of the main text, and let it move when the text expands; or should I put the button somewhere it can remain static while the text expands below/beside it? Is it best to use minimal JS to control the expanding text or should I take over from CSS completely? I suspect I'll answer my own questions while I design the script.
